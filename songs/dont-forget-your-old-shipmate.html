<h1>Donâ€™t Forget Your Old Shipmate</h1>
<p>Safe and sound at home again, let the waters roar, Jack.<br />
Safe and sound at home again, let the waters roar, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>Long we've tossed on the rolling main, now we're safe ashore, Jack.</strong><br />
<strong>Don't forget yer old shipmate, faldee raldee raldee raldee rye-eye-doe!</strong></p>
<p>Since we sailed from Plymouth Sound, four years gone, or nigh, Jack.<br />
Was there ever chummies, now, such as you and I, Jack?</p>
<p>We have worked the self-same gun, quarterdeck division.<br />
Sponger I and loader you, through the whole commission.</p>
<p>Oftentimes have we laid out, toil nor danger fearing,<br />
Tugging out the flapping sail to the weather earring.</p>
<p>When the middle watch was on, and the time went slow, boy,<br />
Who could choose a rousing stave, who like Jack or Joe, boy?</p>
<p>There she swings, an empty hulk, not a soul below now.<br />
Number seven starboard mess misses Jack and Joe now.</p>
<p>But the best of friends must part, fair or foul the weather.<br />
Hand yer flipper for a shake, now a drink together.</p>
