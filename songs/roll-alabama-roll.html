<h1>Roll Alabama Roll</h1>
<p>When the Alabama's keel was laid,<br />
<strong>Roll, Alabama, roll!</strong><br />
It was laid in the yard of Jonathan Laird.<br />
<strong>Oh, roll, Alabama, roll!</strong></p>
<p>Down the Mersey ways she rolled then;<br />
Liverpool fitted her with guns and men.</p>
<p>From the Western Isles she sailed forth,<br />
To destroy the commerce of the North.</p>
<p>The Alabama sailed for two whole years,<br />
Took sixty-five ships in her career.</p>
<p><em>With British guns, oh, she was stocked;</em><br />
<em>She sailed from Fayal; in Cherbourg she docked.</em></p>
<p>To Cherbourg port she sailed one day<br />
To collect her share of the prize money.</p>
<p><em>But off Cherbourg the Kearsarge lay tight,</em><br />
<em>With Cap'n Winslow spoilin' for a fight.</em></p>
<p>Many a sailor lad saw his doom,<br />
When the Yankee Kearsarge hove in view.</p>
<p>'Twas a ball from the forward pivot that day,<br />
Shot the Alabama's keel away.</p>
<p>Off the three-mile limit, in sixty-four,<br />
They sent the Alabama to the cold ocean floor.</p>
<p>When the Alabamaâ€™s keel was laid,<br />
It was laid in the yard of Jonathan Laird.</p>
