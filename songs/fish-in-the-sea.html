<h1>Fish in the Sea</h1>
<p>Come all you young sailormen, listen to me<br />
I'll sing you a song of the fish in the sea,<br />
and it's...</p>
<p><strong>Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys</strong><br />
<strong>When the wind blows we're all together, boys</strong><br />
<strong>Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow</strong><br />
<strong>Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.</strong></p>
<p>Up jumps the eel with his slippery tail,<br />
Climbs up aloft and reefs the topsail,<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Then up jumps the shark with his nine rows of teeth<br />
Saying, 'You eat the dough boys, and I'll eat the beef!'<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Up jumps the lobster with his heavy claws,<br />
Bites the main boom right off by the jaws!<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Up jumps the halibut, lies flat on the deck<br />
He says, 'Mister Captain, don't step on my neck!'<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Up jumps the herring, the king of the sea,<br />
Saying, 'All other fishes, now you follow me!'<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Up jumps the codfish with his chuckle-head,<br />
He runs out up forward and throws out the lead!<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Up jumps the whale, the largest of all,<br />
'If you want any wind, well, I'll blow ye a squall!'<br />
and it'sâ€¦</p>
