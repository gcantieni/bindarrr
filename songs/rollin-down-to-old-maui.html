<h1>Rollin’ Down to Old Maui</h1>
<p><em><strong>The first song the crew ever forgot during a show</strong></em></p>
<p>It’s a damn tough life full of toil and strife we whalermen undergo<br />
And we don’t give a damn when the whaling’s done how hard the winds did blow<br />
‘Cause we’re homeward bound from the Arctic Ground with a good ship taut and free<br />
And we won’t give a damn when we drink our rum on the shores of old Maui</p>
<p><strong>Rollin’ down to old Maui, me boys, rollin’ down to old Maui</strong><br />
<strong>We’re homeward bound from the Arctic Ground, rollin’ down to old Maui</strong></p>
<p>Once more we sail with the northerly gale through the ice and wind and rain<br />
Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands, we soon shall see again<br />
Six hellish months we’ve passed away on the cold Kamchatka Sea,<br />
But now we’re bound from the Arctic Ground, rollin’ down to old Maui</p>
<p>Once more we sail with the northerly gale towards our island home<br />
Our main mast sprung, our whaling done, and we ain’t got far to roam<br />
Our stuns’l boom’s been carried away, what care we for that sound<br />
A living gale is after us, thank God we’re homeward bound</p>
