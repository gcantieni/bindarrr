<h1>Cockles And Mussels</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty<br />
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone<br />
As she wheeled her wheel-barrow</p>
<p><strong>Through streets broad and narrow</strong><br />
<strong>Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o!"</strong><br />
<strong>Alive, alive-o, alive, alive-o!</strong><br />
<strong>Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o!"</strong></p>
<p>She was a fishmonger, but sure 'twas no wonder<br />
For so were her father and mother before<br />
And they each wheeled their barrow<br />
<strong>Through…</strong></p>
<p>She died of a faver, and no one could save her<br />
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone<br />
But her ghost wheels her barrow<br />
<strong>Through…</strong></p>
