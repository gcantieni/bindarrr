<h1>Agamemnon</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Corvis the Nightterror</strong></em></p>
<p>Where is Henry Adams now, that planned the Agamemnon?<br />
Foundered on the River Plate, in Maldonaldos Bay.<br />
<strong>Oak and iron blood of her, his fine one, his darling,</strong><br />
<strong>Sink him in his hammock, boys, he’s gone far away!</strong></p>
<p>Where are all the Beaulieu boys, that built the Agamemnon?<br />
Let them lie ’neath waving grass, contented where they lay.<br />
<strong>Swords and swinging riveters, their sounds will not be waking them,</strong><br />
<strong>Sink them in their hammocks, boys, they’ve gone far away!</strong></p>
<p>Where is Captain Nelson now, that sailed the Agamemnon?<br />
Fought and beat the Spanish crews in Cape St Vincent Bay —<br />
<strong>Oak and iron blood of her, his fine one, his darling,—</strong><br />
<strong>Broach the keg of brandy, boys, and send him far away!</strong></p>
<p>Where are all the jolly tars, that crewed the Agamemnon?<br />
Men for whom the carronades were less hard work than play.<br />
<strong>Oak and iron blood were they, and every girl a darling,</strong><br />
<strong>Sink them in their hammocks, lads, they’ve gone far away!</strong></p>
<p>Sing the shanty loud, my boys, we’ll rouse the Agamemnon!<br />
Stamp it round her capstan and her anchor we will weigh.<br />
<strong>Where are all the wooden walls, the cloud of sails a-bearing,</strong><br />
<strong>They’re foundered, sunk or broken, and they’ve gone far away!</strong></p>
<p>Where is Henry Adams now, that planned the Agamemnon?<br />
Foundered on the River Plate, in Maldonaldos Bay.<br />
<strong>Oak and iron blood of her, his fine one, his darling,</strong><br />
<strong>Sink him in his hammock, boys, he’s gone far away!</strong></p>
