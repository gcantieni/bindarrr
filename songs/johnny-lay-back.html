<h1>Johnny Lay Back</h1>
<p>’Twas a cold a dreary morning in December <em>(December)</em><br />
An’ all of me money it was spent <em>(spent spent)</em><br />
Where it went to, Lord I can’t remember <em>(remember)</em><br />
So down to the shipping office I went <em>(went went)</em></p>
<p><strong>Johnny lay back</strong> <em>(Johnny lay back!)</em><br />
<strong>Take in the slack</strong> <em>(Take in the slack!)</em><br />
<strong>Take a turn around the capstan heave a pawl</strong> <em>(Heave a pawl!)</em><br />
<strong>About ship’s stations, boys, be handy</strong> <em>(Be handy!)</em><br />
<strong>For we’re bound for Valipariso ’round the Horn</strong></p>
<p>That day there was a great demand for sailors<br />
For the colonies, for ’Frisco and for France<br />
So I shipped aboard a limey barque <em>The Hotspur</em><br />
And got completely drunk on my advance</p>
<p>I woke up in the morning sick and sore-o<br />
And I knew that I was outward bound again<br />
When I heard a voice a-bawling at the door-o<br />
“Lay aloft ye sods and answer to your names!”</p>
<p>’Twas on the quarter deck where first I saw ’em<br />
Such an ugly bunch I never seen before<br />
For there was a bum and stiff from every quarter<br />
And it made me poor old heart feel sick and sore</p>
<p>I asked the mate a-which a-watch was mine-o<br />
Says he “I’ll soon pick out a-which is which”<br />
And he blowed me down and kicked me hard astern-o<br />
Calling me a lousy dirty son-of-a-bitch</p>
<p>So there I was a-once more out to sea boys<br />
The same ol’ bloody business o’er again<br />
Oh, stamp the capstan ’round and make some noise, boys<br />
And sing again this dear ol’ sweet refrain</p>
