<h1>Sammy’s Bar</h1>
<p><em><strong>Cyril Tawney</strong></em></p>
<p>I went down to Sammy’s Bar<br />
<strong>Hey, the last boat’s a-leaving</strong><br />
By the shore at Pieta<br />
<strong>Call away the di-so</strong></p>
<p>And my real love, she was there<br />
There was sand all in her hair</p>
<p>How did sand get in your hair<br />
Darling Johnny put it there</p>
<p>Been with Johnny all the day<br />
Down at Ghajn Tuffheija Bay</p>
<p>He’s a better man by far<br />
Because he’s got a Yankee car</p>
<p>I went out from Sammy’s Bar<br />
Had to hire a Yankee car</p>
<p>Fourteen days I drank no wine<br />
Saving for that love of mine</p>
<p>Then one day in Paula square<br />
At a paper I did stare</p>
<p>Johnny tried a hairpin bend<br />
For my love, it was the end</p>
<p>Going back to Sammy’s Bar</p>
<p>I don’t need no Yankee car</p>
