<h1>Old King Coal</h1>
<p><em>John Kirkpatrick</em></p>
<p>Under the ground lay Old King Coal<br />
He lay most peacefully<br />
He ruled in might and splendour<br />
There was none so grand as he<br />
But men came along to tunnel him out<br />
And topple him from his throne<br />
They tore him down to steal his crown<br />
For the power in the old black stone.</p>
<p><strong>There's fire in the heart of Old King Coal</strong><br />
<strong>There's the strength of centuries in his soul</strong><br />
<strong>There's a power that grows where his black blood flows</strong><br />
<strong>So here's to Old King Coal.</strong></p>
<p>So they scratched him, hacked him, and harried him out<br />
They ripped him from his bed<br />
And they blasted his bones asunder<br />
They'd sworn to see him dead<br />
Then they carried him out to the sun's bright light<br />
Which blinded him in the eye<br />
And the blood did drain from every vein<br />
Until they'd drained him dry.</p>
<p>Then they cracked his bones on the grinding stones<br />
How gleefully they did grind<br />
Oh how they pulverized him<br />
Turned him to dust so fine<br />
Then they sprayed him into the furnace fire<br />
And burned him in the air<br />
With a mighty blast they burned him fast<br />
As he prayed his final prayer.</p>
<p>And his soul cried out with a final song<br />
As he reached his final hour<br />
And his heart it burst with singing<br />
So mighty was the power<br />
And he sang the water into steam<br />
And the steam made the wheels fly round<br />
And the song ran on both pure and strong<br />
Till the wires hummed with its sound.</p>
<p>Out of the darkness there comes light<br />
Out of the earth comes fire<br />
Out of the cold comes comfort<br />
As his bones go blazing higher<br />
And his soul flies out through the air we breathe<br />
And down on the earth we tread<br />
That humankind may not forget<br />
That Old King Coal is dead.</p>
