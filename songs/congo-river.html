<h1>Congo River</h1>
<p>Was you ever on the Congo River?<br />
<strong>Blow, boys, blow</strong><br />
Where fever makes the sailor shiver<br />
<strong>Blow me bully boys, blow</strong></p>
<p>A Yankee ship came down the river<br />
Her masts and yards they shone like silver…</p>
<p>How d’you know she’s a Yankee clipper?<br />
By the blood an’ guts that flow from her scuppers</p>
<p>Yonder came the Arrow packet<br />
She fired her guns an’ I heard the racket</p>
<p>And who do you think was the skipper of her?<br />
It’s old Bully Hayes; he’s a sailor robber</p>
<p>And who do you think was chief mate of her?<br />
Why Boss-eyed Bill the Bowery Bastard</p>
<p>And what do you think that they had for breakfast?<br />
The starboard side of an old sou’wester</p>
<p>And what do you think that they had for dinner?<br />
A monkey’s heart and a donkey’s liver</p>
<p>And what do you think that they had for supper?<br />
Belaying pin pie and a roll in the scupper</p>
<p>Blow today and blow tomorrow<br />
And blow me from this ship of sorrow</p>
<p>Blow today and blow forever<br />
And blow me down the Congo River</p>
