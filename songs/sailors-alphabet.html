<h1>Sailor’s Alphabet</h1>
<p><em><strong>Adapted by Barefoot the Bootless</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Merrily, cheerily, so marry are we,</strong><br />
<strong>No mortal on earth’s like a pirate at sea.</strong><br />
<strong>Heave away haul away, sail right along,</strong><br />
<strong>Give a pirate his grog and there’s nothing go wrong.</strong></p>
<p>A is for Anchor we carry on our bow<br />
B is our boatswain who sings way to loud<br />
C is our Captain, drowned in mizzen chain<br />
D is debauchery over which we do reign</p>
<p>E is for England who we love so well<br />
F is for Firth, who can drink us to hell<br />
G is for gay, I need not say more<br />
H is for himbo, on Scotland’s fine shore</p>
<p>I is for Ireland, where Guinness comes from<br />
J is for Jaeger, the drink and alum<br />
K is Kraken, our favorite rum<br />
L is landlubber of which we have none</p>
<p>M’s for mafia, they surely aren’t here<br />
N’s Narragansett, our favorite beer<br />
O is for Ocean over which we do roam<br />
P is for Providence, it feels just like home</p>
<p>Q is for quahog, a clam just for me<br />
R’s for Rhode Island, where we Hope to be<br />
S is for Salem, a place on Cape Cod<br />
T is for Tim Finnigan who carried a hod</p>
<p>U’s uisce beatha[^28], the water of life<br />
V is for vodka, a bottle will suffice<br />
W is for whisky, to waste it’s a crime<br />
For the last two letters, we just don’t have time</p>
