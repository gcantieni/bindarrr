<h1>Collier’s Song</h1>
<p><strong>I can hew, boys, I can hack it out </strong><br />
<strong>I can hew the coal, I can dance and shout </strong><br />
<strong>I can hew, boys, coal so black and fine </strong><br />
<strong>I’m a collier lad, working down the mine </strong></p>
<p>It’s Saint Monday’s day, and well I do admire<br />
To sit snug at home by my own coal fire<br />
Then it’s down to the pub for a pint or two<br />
For to work on Monday, that would never do</p>
<p>Now my son’s fourteen, he’s a strapping lad<br />
He’ll go down to the mine just like his dad<br />
And when Friday comes we’ll pick up our pay<br />
And we’ll drink together to round out the day</p>
<p>Well, I likes me whiskey and I likes me beer<br />
I’ll drink fourteen pints and I’ll not feel queer<br />
I can hold my liquor as well as any man<br />
And I’ll dance and sing as long as I can</p>
<p>And it’s when I die then I know full well<br />
I’ll not go to Heaven, I am bound for Hell<br />
And my pick and shovel, Old Nick he will admire<br />
And he’ll set me to hewing coal for his own Hellfire</p>
