<h1>Paddy on the Railway</h1>
<p>From Meister Jaeger</p>
<p>In 1841 I put me corduroy britches on<br />
I put me corduroy britches on<br />
To work upon the railway</p>
<p><strong>Tira me ori ori ay, tira me ori ori ay</strong><br />
<strong>Tira me ori ori ay, to work upon the railway </strong></p>
<p>In 1842 I left the old land for the new<br />
Bad cess to the luck that brought me through<br />
To work upon the railway</p>
<p>In 1843 we hit Chicago on a spree<br />
The devil got a hold of me<br />
While working on the railway</p>
<p>In 1844 while standing on the great lake shore<br />
We laid the track then saw no more<br />
While working on the railway</p>
<p>In 1845 when Daniel O'Connell was alive<br />
In Kansas City we did arrive<br />
To work upon the railway</p>
<p>In 1846 had a pain in me ass from carrying bricks<br />
With hammers and nails and shovels and picks<br />
A working upon the railway</p>
<p>It's Paddy do this and Paddy do that<br />
Without a stocking or cravat <em>(or: me boss is loud, and he is fat)</em><br />
And nothing but an old straw hat <em>(Iâ€™ve had enough shite to fill up me hat)</em><br />
While working on the railway</p>
<p>In 1848 me hands did blister and me belly did ache<br />
We heard of gold and made a stake<br />
While working on the railway</p>
<p>In 1849 the California hills looked fine<br />
We found some gold and left behind<br />
The workings of the railway</p>
