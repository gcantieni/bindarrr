<h1>Morning Glory</h1>
<p><strong>One for the <em>Morning Glory</em></strong><br />
<strong>Two for the sweet brown brew</strong><br />
<strong>Three for the man who’ll stand his round</strong><br />
<strong>And four for the love of you, me girls</strong><br />
<strong>Four for the love of you</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day I like a couple drinks when I raise up my voice and sing<br />
An hour or two with the fine brown brew and I’m ready for anything<br />
At the Cross Keys Inn there were sisters four, the landlord’s daughters fair<br />
And every night when they turned out the light they would lead me up the stairs.</p>
<p>I got the call from foreign shores to go and fight the foe<br />
And I thought no more of the sisters four though they cried to see me go<br />
I sailed away on a ship, the <em>Morning Glory</em> was her name<br />
We’d all fall down when the rum went round, then get up and drink again</p>
<p>I bore once more to my native shore, farewell to the raging main<br />
The Cross Keys Inn, it was beckoning, with the rum to ease my pain<br />
But there on the shore were the sisters four with a bundle upon each knee<br />
There were three little girls and a bouncing boy and they all looked just like me</p>
