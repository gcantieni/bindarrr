<h1>The Coasts Of High Barbary</h1>
<p>Look ahead, look astern,<br />
Look the weather and the lee<br />
<strong>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we</strong><br />
I see a wreck to windward,<br />
And a lofty ship to lee,<br />
<strong>A-sailing down along the coasts of High Barbary</strong></p>
<p>"Oh, are you a pirate<br />
Or a man-o'-war?" cried he...<br />
"Oh no, we are not men of war,<br />
But men of ARRR!!!" cried we...</p>
<p>Well back up your topsails<br />
And heave your vessel to...<br />
For we have got some letters<br />
To be carried home by you...</p>
<p>We'll back up our topsails<br />
And heave our vessel to...<br />
But only in some harbour<br />
And along the side of you...</p>
<p>For broadside for broadside<br />
We fought all on the main...<br />
Until at last the pirate<br />
Shot the frigate's mast away...</p>
<p>"For quarters! For quarters!"<br />
The saucy sailors cried...<br />
The quarters that we showed them<br />
Was to sink them in the tide...</p>
<p>With cutlass and gun<br />
Oh, we fought for hours three...<br />
Their ship it was their coffin,<br />
And their grave it was the sea...</p>
