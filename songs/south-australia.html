<h1>South Australia</h1>
<p>In South Australia I was born<br />
<strong>Heave away, haul away </strong><br />
South Australia, ’round Cape Horn<br />
<strong>We’re bound for South Australia </strong></p>
<p><strong>Haul away you rolling kings </strong><br />
<strong>Heave away, haul away </strong><br />
<strong>Haul away you’ll hear me say </strong><br />
<strong>We’re bound for South Australia </strong></p>
<p>If there’s just one thing that grieves my mind<br />
To leave Miss Nancy Blair’s behind</p>
<p>Oh when we wallop ’round Cape Horn<br />
You’ll wish to God you’d never been born</p>
<p>I wish I was in Australia’s strand<br />
A glass of whiskey in my hand</p>
<p>Port Adelaide’s a grand old town<br />
There’s plenty of girls to go around</p>
<p>South Australia’s my native land<br />
Full of flies and fleas and sand</p>
<p>When I first shipped out to sea<br />
My girl said she’d be true to me</p>
<p>South Australia’s got great waves<br />
Great white sharks and surfer babes</p>
<p>Hamlet’s uncle’s got him down<br />
Married his mom and stole his crown</p>
