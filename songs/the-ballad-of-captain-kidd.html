<h1>The Ballad Of Captain Kidd</h1>
<p>My name is Captain Kidd <strong>as I sailed, as I sailed</strong><br />
<strong>My name is Captain Kidd as I sailed.</strong><br />
<strong>My name is Captain Kidd</strong>, and wickedly I did<br />
And wickedly I did <strong>as I sailed, as I sailed</strong><br />
<strong>And wickedly I did as I sailed.</strong></p>
<p>My parents taught me well…<br />
<strong>My parents taught mewell</strong> to shun the gates of Hell<br />
But against them I rebelled…</p>
<p>I’d a Bible in my hand…<br />
<strong>I’d a Bible in my hand; </strong>I sunk it in the sand<br />
Before I left the strand…</p>
<p>I spied three ships of Spain…<br />
<strong>I spied three ships of Spain</strong>; I fired on them the main<br />
‘Til all three crew was slain…</p>
<p>I’d eighty bars of gold…<br />
<strong>I’d eighty bars of gold </strong>and dollars in the hold<br />
And riches uncontrolled…</p>
<p>I murdered William Moore…<br />
<strong>I murdered William Moore </strong>and left him in his gore<br />
Full forty leagues from shore…</p>
<p>O’ertaken now at last…<br />
<strong>O’ertaken now at last</strong> and into prison cast<br />
And sentence being passed…</p>
<p>To execution dock <strong>I must go, I must go</strong><br />
<strong>To execution dock I must go</strong><br />
<strong>To execution dock</strong> while thousands ‘round me flock<br />
To see me on the block <strong>as I go, as I go</strong><br />
<strong>To see me on the block as I go</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>They called me Captain Kidd as I sailed, as I sailed.</strong><br />
<strong>They called me Captain Kidd, and wickedly I did</strong><br />
<strong>And wickedly I did as I sailed, as I sailed.</strong></p>
