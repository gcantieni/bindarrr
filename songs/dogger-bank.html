<h1>Dogger Bank</h1>
<hr />
<p><em><strong>From Rabies the Regularly Bitten</strong></em></p>
<p>Sailing over the Dogger Bank, oh, wasn't it a treat?<br />
The wind a-blowing east-northeast, we had to give our sheet<br />
You should to see us rally, the wind a-blowing free<br />
On a passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby</p>
<p><strong>So watch her, twig her, she's a proper juby-ju</strong><br />
<strong>Give 'er sheet, let 'er rip, we're the boys to see her through</strong><br />
<strong>You should to see us rally, the wind a-blowing free</strong><br />
<strong>On a passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby</strong></p>
<p>Now the captain, he's a shangaroosh, and he loves a drop of good ale<br />
The mate, he is a chimney sweep, and been in many a jail<br />
The third hand was a bricker boy, thе worst of all the crew<br />
And take a look at thе poor old cook, he gets the buggers through</p>
<p>So it's watch her, twig her, it's down the street she came<br />
With high heels and painted toes, good Jinnie is on the game<br />
She is one of them flash girls, can't she cut a shine?<br />
She can do a double shuffle on the Knickerbocker Line</p>
<p>Now, we're the boys to make a noise when we come home from sea<br />
We get right drunk, we roll on the floor, we have a jubilee<br />
We get right drunk and full of beer, we roll all over the floor<br />
And when the rent it is all spent, we'll go to sea for more</p>
