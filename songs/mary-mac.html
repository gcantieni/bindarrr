<h1>Mary Mac</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Tripple Nipple Jones</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Mary Mac's mother's making Mary Mac marry me,</strong><br />
<strong>My mother's making me marry Mary Mac</strong><br />
<strong>I'm gonna marry Mary so that Mary will take care o' me,</strong><br />
<strong>Well I’ll be feeling merry when I marry Mary Mac</strong><br />
<strong>Do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do</strong></p>
<p>This little girl, her name is Mary Mac,<br />
Make no mistake she's the girl I’m gonna track,<br />
A lot of other fella's want to get her on her back,<br />
But I'm thinkin' that they'll have to get up early</p>
<p>Now this wee lass, she’s got a lot of class,<br />
Got a lot of cash, she thinks I'm a gas,<br />
I'd be a silly ass, to let the matter pass,<br />
Her father thinks she suits me very fairly</p>
<p>Now Mary and her mother gang an awful lot together,<br />
In fact you hardly ever see the one without the other,<br />
And people wonder whether it is Mary or her mother,<br />
Or both of them together that I'm courtin'</p>
<p>Now the weddin' day 's on Wednesday, and everything's arranged,<br />
Her name will soon be changed to mine, unless her mind is changed,<br />
I'm making the arrangements, it’s making me deranged,<br />
For marriage is an awful undertaking</p>
<p>It's sure to be a grand affair and grander than a fair<br />
There's going to be a coach and pair for every couple there<br />
We'll dine upon the finest fare I'm sure to get my share<br />
If I don't we'll all be very much mistaken</p>
<p>This little girl, her name is Mary Mac,<br />
Make no mistake she's the girl I’m gonna track,<br />
A lot of other fella's want to get her on her back,<br />
