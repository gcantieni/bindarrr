<h1>Spanish Ladies</h1>
<p>Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish Ladies,<br />
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain<br />
For we've received orders for to sail for old England<br />
But we hope in short time for to see you again</p>
<p><strong>We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors,</strong><br />
<strong>We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas</strong><br />
<strong>Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England</strong><br />
<strong>From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues</strong></p>
<p>We hove our ship to with the wind from sou'west, boys<br />
We hove our ship to, deep soundings to take<br />
'Twas forty-five fathoms, with a white sandy bottom,<br />
So we squared our main yard and up channel did make</p>
<p>The first land we sighted was call-ed the Dodman,<br />
Next Rame Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland and Wight<br />
We sailed by Beachy, by Fairlight and Dover<br />
And then we bore up for the South Foreland light</p>
<p>Then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor,<br />
And all in the Downs that night for to lie<br />
Let go your shank painter, let go your cat stopper<br />
Haul up your clewgarnets, let tacks and sheets fly!</p>
<p>Now let ev'ry man drink off his full bumper,<br />
And let ev'ry man drink off his full glass<br />
We'll drink and be jolly and drown melancholy,<br />
And here's to the health of each true-hearted lass.</p>
