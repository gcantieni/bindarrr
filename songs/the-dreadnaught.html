<h1>The Dreadnaught</h1>
<p>There is a flash packet and a packet of fame<br />
She hails from New York and the dreadnaught’s her name<br />
She’s bound to the west where the wide waters flow!<br />
Bound away to the westward in the Dreadnaught we go<br />
<strong>Derry down, down, down derry down.</strong></p>
<p>The time of her sailing is now drawing nigh<br />
Farewell pretty maids, we must bid you goodbye<br />
A pair of clean heels now to you we will show<br />
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go</p>
<p>Now the Dreadnaught is lying in the river Mercy<br />
Awaiting the tugboat to tow her to sea<br />
For to round the rock light where the salt tides do flow<br />
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go</p>
<p>Now the Dreadnaught’s a-bowlin down the wild Irish Sea<br />
Her passengers merry; their hearts full of glee<br />
Her sailors like tigers walk the decks to and fro<br />
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go</p>
<p>Now the Dreadnaught’s a-sailing the Atlantic so wide<br />
While the dark, heavy seas roll along her black sides,<br />
With her tops’ls set taut for the red cross to show<br />
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go</p>
<p>Now the dreadnaught’s arriving in old New York town<br />
We’re bound for the bow’ry and let sorrow drown<br />
With our gals and our beer, boys we’ll let the song flow!<br />
She’s a saucy flash packet; oh lord let her go!</p>
<p>Here’s a health to the Dreadnaught and all her brave crew<br />
To bold captain Samuels and his officers too<br />
You may talk of your fliers Swallowtail and Black Ball<br />
But the Dreadnaught’s the packet that outsails them all!</p>
