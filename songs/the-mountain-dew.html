<h1>The Mountain Dew</h1>
<p><em><strong>Formerly in the Irish Packet</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Aye a-diddlee aye dul dum[^15]</strong><br />
<strong>Diddlee oodle aye dul dum</strong><br />
<strong>Diddlee doo rye diddlee aye ay</strong> <em>[x2]</em></p>
<p>Let grasses grow and water flow in a free and easy way<br />
Just give me enough of the rare old stuff that’s grown near Galway Bay<br />
The police men from old Donegal, Sligo and Lietrim, too<br />
We’ll give them the slip and we’ll take a sip of the rare old mountain dew</p>
<p>At the foot of the hill there’s a neat little still where the smoke curls up to the sky<br />
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell there’s poitin[^16] brewing nearby<br />
It fills the air with odor rare, but betwixt both me and you<br />
When home we go you can take a bowl or a bucket of the mountain dew</p>
<p>Now learned men who use the pen have wrote your praises high<br />
That sweet poitin from Ireland green is stilled from wheat and rye<br />
Put away your pills, it’ll cure all ills, whether Pagan or Christian or Jew<br />
Take off your coat and grease your throat with a bucket of the mountain dew</p>
