<h1>The Mountain Dew</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p><strong>Aye a-diddlee aye dul dum</strong> (NOTE: This is called "lilting." Sing this exactly, all the time, without fail. Note: drinking makes this easier. Also, Bones is da Bess.)<br />
<strong>Diddlee oodle aye dul dum</strong><br />
<strong>Diddlee doo rye diddlee aye ay </strong><em>[x2]</em></p>
<p>Let grasses grow and water flow in a free and easy way<br />
Just give me enough of the rare old stuff that’s grown near Galway Bay<br />
The police men from old Donegal, Sligo and Lietrim, too<br />
We’ll give them the slip and we’ll take a sip of the rare old mountain dew</p>
<p>At the foot of the hill there’s a neat little still where the smoke curls up to the sky<br />
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell there’s poitin (NOTE: Pronounced ‘potcheen’: an Irish beverage distilled from potatoes or barley – so incredibly alcoholic (60 – 95 0x0p+0bv) that for centuries it was illegal in Ireland. ) brewing nearby<br />
It fills the air with odor rare, but betwixt both me and you<br />
When home we go you can take a bowl or a bucket of the mountain dew</p>
<p>Now learned men who use the pen have wrote your praises high<br />
That sweet poitin from Ireland green is stilled from wheat and rye<br />
Put away your pills, it’ll cure all ills, be you Pagan or Christian or Jew<br />
Take off your coat and grease your throat with a bucket of the mountain dew</p>
