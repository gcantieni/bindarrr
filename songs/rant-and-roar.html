<h1>Rant and Roar</h1>
<p><strong>We'll rant and we'll roar like true Newfoundlanders</strong><br />
<strong>We'll rant and we'll roar on deck and below</strong><br />
<strong>Until we strikes bottom inside the two sunkers</strong><br />
<strong>When straight through the channel to Toslow we'll go</strong></p>
<p>I'm a son of a sea cook; I'm a cook and a trader<br />
I can dance, I can sing, I can reef the main boom<br />
I can handle a jigger, I cuts a fine figure<br />
Whenever I gets in a boat standing room</p>
<p>Farewell and adieu to ye young maids of Valen<br />
Oderin and Presque, Fox Hole and Bruley<br />
I'm bound for the westward to the wall with the hole in<br />
I can't marry all or a chokey I'll be</p>
