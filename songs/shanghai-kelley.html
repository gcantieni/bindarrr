<h1>Shanghai Kelley</h1>
<hr />
<p>**<em>Gaelic Storm</em> **</p>
<p>Well on me own in San Francisco, in the year of 1849<br />
No money in me pockets, but there's mischief on me mind<br />
It was Jimmy Kelly’s birthday, a businessman of high renown<br />
He said he'd host a party, he invited half the town!<br />
He said we'd all go drinkin’ on a paddle-steamer in the bay<br />
With barrels full of whiskey; sure we didn't have to pay<br />
But Kelly swiped the liquor, with a jigger full of maudlin<br />
A pint of chloral-hydrate and a shot of opium!</p>
<p><strong>Beat-down! Black-eyed!</strong><br />
<strong>Hobbled-up and hog-tied!</strong><br />
<strong>Shipped-out! Shanghai’ed!</strong><br />
<strong>Ne'er a "fare thee well"!</strong><br />
<strong>Rope-burned! Whip-cracked!</strong><br />
<strong>Burnt-back and hard-tack!</strong><br />
<strong>Davey Jones will steal your bones and send you down to Hell! (x2)</strong></p>
<p>Well a lot of us, we hit the floor, ninety men or maybe more<br />
They rolled us up in blankets and they dragged us to the door<br />
They sold us to the Reefer just before she passed the Golden Gate<br />
Before we all got sober, we were married to our fate<br />
And miles away from all I knew, stranded with this rotten crew<br />
With naught but work for us to do until we reached Peru<br />
With blistered hands we'd haul the line, man the sails, swab the deck<br />
And dream of Shanghai Kelly with a rope around his neck!</p>
<p>Now if you meet that Shanghai Kelly, you'd best take care around the booze<br />
A pint of piquet special, and you're surely bound to lose<br />
A year at sea and all I've got, when they dumped me on the docks<br />
A broken heart, a broken head, the scurvy and the pox (x2)</p>
