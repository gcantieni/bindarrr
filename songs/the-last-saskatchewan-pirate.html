<h1>The Last Saskatchewan Pirate</h1>
<p>Oh, I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine<br />
I had a little stretch of land along the CP line<br />
But times were hard and though I tried, the money wasn't there<br />
And bankers came and took my land and told me fair is fair<br />
I looked for every kind of job, the answer always "no"<br />
Hire you now, they'd always laugh, we just let twenty go!<br />
The government, they promised me a measly little sum<br />
But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum<br />
Then I thought who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone<br />
I'm gonna be a PIRATE! on the River Saskatchewan!</p>
<p><strong>Cause it's a heave-ho! hi-ho!</strong><br />
<strong>Coming down the plains</strong><br />
<strong>Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains</strong><br />
<strong>And it's a ho-hey! hi-hey!</strong><br />
<strong>Farmers bar your doors</strong><br />
<strong>When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores</strong></p>
<p>Well you think the locals farmers would know that I'm at large<br />
But, just the other day I saw an unprotected barge<br />
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser<br />
I rammed their ship, and sank it, and I stole their fertilizer!<br />
A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river<br />
The farmers pass in so much fear, their stomachs are a-quiver<br />
Because the know that TRACTOR JACK! is waiting in the bay<br />
I'll jump the bridge and knock them cold and sail off with their hay!</p>
<p>Well Mountie Bob he chased me, he was always at my throat<br />
He'd follow on the shoreline because he didn't own a boat<br />
But cutbacks were a-coming and the Mountie lost his job<br />
Now he's sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob<br />
A swingin' sword, and skull n' bones, and pleasant company<br />
I never pay my income tax and screw the GST â€” SCREW IT!<br />
Prince Albert down to Saskatoon, I'm the terror of the sea<br />
If ya wanna reach the Co-op, boy, you gotta get by me!</p>
<p>Well, pirate life's appealing, but you don't just find it here<br />
I've heard that in Alberta, there's a band of buccaneers<br />
They roam the Athabasca, from Smith to Fort McKay<br />
And you're gonna lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way<br />
Well winter is a-coming and a chill is in the breeze<br />
Our pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze<br />
I'll be back in springtime, but now I've to go<br />
I hear there's lots of plundering down in New Mexico</p>
