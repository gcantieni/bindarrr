<h1>Pump Shanty</h1>
<p><strong>Pump me boys, pump her dry </strong><br />
<strong>Down to hell and up to the sky </strong><br />
<strong>Bend your back and break your bones </strong><br />
<strong>We’re just a thousand miles from home </strong></p>
<p>They say life has its ups and downs<br />
That really now is quite profound<br />
I’d like to push the capstan round<br />
But it’s pump me boys before we drown</p>
<p>The captain's daughter I suppose<br />
Could be called an English Rose<br />
What would you think when I propose<br />
The pox she gave to me a dose.</p>
<p>This rose well she did prick me sore<br />
I never felt so bad before<br />
Thanks to the girl I do adore<br />
I thought I'd never pump no more.</p>
<p>I called the doctor right away<br />
To find out what he had to say<br />
That's two pounds ten, get on your way<br />
I'm sure this girl is in his pay.</p>
<p>Sometimes while lying in me bed<br />
And thinking of me day ahead<br />
I wish that I could wake up dead<br />
But pumpin's all I get instead</p>
<p>The ocean we all do adore<br />
So come on lads let's pump some more<br />
Don't worry if you’re stiff and sore<br />
I'm sure we've pumped this bit before..</p>
<p>There's so much water down below<br />
Just how it got there I don't know<br />
The old man says let's roll and go<br />
But I think we're bound for Davey Jones.</p>
