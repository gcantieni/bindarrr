<h1>The Irish Rover</h1>
<p>In the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and six<br />
We set sail from the Coal Quay of Cork<br />
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks<br />
For the grand City Hall in New York<br />
We’d an elegant craft, it was rigged ’fore and aft<br />
And how the trade winds drove her<br />
She had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts<br />
And they called her the Irish Rover</p>
<p>There was Barney Magee from the banks of the Lee<br />
There was Hogan from County Tyrone<br />
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work<br />
And a chap from Westmeath named Malone<br />
There was Slugger O’Toole, who was drunk as a rule<br />
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover<br />
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann<br />
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover</p>
<p>There was awl Mickey Coote, who played hard on his flute<br />
When the ladies lined up for his set<br />
He was tooting with skill for each sparkling quadrille<br />
Though the dancers were fluttered and bet<br />
With his sparse, witty talk he was cock of the walk<br />
As he rolled the dames under and over<br />
They all knew at a glance when he took off his pants<br />
That he sailed in the Irish Rover</p>
<p>We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags<br />
We had two million barrels of bone<br />
We had three million bales of old nanny goats’ tails<br />
We had four million barrels of stone<br />
We had five million hogs and six million dogs<br />
And seven million barrels of porter<br />
We had eight million sides of old blind horses’ hides<br />
In the hold of the Irish Rover</p>
<p>We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out<br />
And our ship lost her way in a fog<br />
And a whale of a crew was reduced down to two<br />
’Twas myself and the captain’s old dog<br />
Then the ship struck a rock, oh, Lord what a shock<br />
And nearly tumbled over<br />
She turned nine times around, then the poor old dog was drowned<br />
I’m the last of the Irish Rover</p>
