<h1>Fields Of Athenry</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young girl calling<br />
"Michael, they have taken you away<br />
For you stole Trevelyan’s corn, so the young might see the morn<br />
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay"</p>
<p><strong>Low lie the fields of Athenry</strong><br />
<strong>Where once we watched the small free birds fly</strong><br />
<strong>Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing</strong><br />
<strong>It’s so lonely ’round the fields of Athenry</strong></p>
<p>By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling<br />
"Nothing matters, Mary, when you’re free<br />
Against the famine and the crown I rebelled, they ran me down<br />
Now you must raise our child with dignity"</p>
<p>By a lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star falling<br />
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky<br />
And she’ll wait and hope and pray, for her love in Botany Bay<br />
It’s so lonely ’round the fields of Athenry</p>
