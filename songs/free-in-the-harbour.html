<h1>Free in the Harbour</h1>
<p><em><strong>Stan Rogers</strong></em></p>
<p>Well it’s blackfish at play in Hermitage Bay<br />
From Pushthrough across to Bois Island<br />
They broach and they sprout and they lift their flukes out<br />
And they wave to a town that is dying<br />
Now it’s many’s the boats that have plied on the foam<br />
Hauling away! Hauling away!<br />
But there’s many more fellas been leaving their homes<br />
Where the whales make free in the harbour.</p>
<p><strong>Free in the harbour</strong><br />
<strong>The blackfish are sporting again</strong><br />
<strong>Free in the harbour</strong><br />
<strong>Untroubled by comings and goings of men</strong><br />
<strong>Who once did pursue them as oil from the sea,</strong><br />
<strong>Hauling away! Hauling away!</strong><br />
<strong>Now they’re Calgary roughnecks from Hermitage Bay</strong><br />
<strong>Where the whales make free in the harbour.</strong></p>
<p>It’s at Portage and Main you’ll see them again<br />
On their way to the hills of Alberta<br />
With lop-side grins, they waggle their chins<br />
And they brag of the wage they’ll be earning<br />
Then it’s “Quick, pull the string boys, and get the tool out,”<br />
Haul it away! Haul it away!<br />
But just two years ago you could hear the same shout<br />
Where the whales make free in the harbour.</p>
<p>Well, it’s living they’ve found, deep in the ground<br />
And if there’s doubts, it’s best they ignore them<br />
Nor think on the bones, the crosses and stones<br />
Of their fathers that came there before them<br />
In the taverns of Edmonton, fishermen shout<br />
Haul it away! Haul it away!<br />
They left three hundred years buried up the Bay<br />
Where the whales make free in the harbour.</p>
