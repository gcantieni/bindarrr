<h1>Drunken Sailor</h1>
<p>What shall we do with a drunken sailor <em>[3x]</em><br />
<strong>Ear-ly in the morning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Way, hey, up she rises</strong> <em>[3x]</em><br />
<strong>Ear-ly in the morning</strong></p>
<p>Put him in the long boat ‘til he’s sober</p>
<p>Put him in the bilge and make him drink it</p>
<p>Put him in a leaky boat and make him bail her</p>
<p>Tie him to the scuppers with the hose pipe on him</p>
<p>Shave his belly with a rusty razor</p>
<p>Tie him to the topmast while she’s yardarm under</p>
<p>Heave him by the leg in a runnin’ bowline</p>
<p>Keel haul him ‘til he’s sober</p>
<p><strong>Went to sea with a drunken sailor</strong><br />
<strong>Six long months in a leaky whaler</strong><br />
<strong>Put him in the hold and made him bail ‘er</strong><br />
<strong>Ear-ly in the morning</strong></p>
