<h1>Heart of Oak</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Barefoot the Bootless</strong></em></p>
<p>Come cheer up my lads 'tis to glory we steer<br />
To add something new to this wonderful year.<br />
To honor we call you as free men not slaves<br />
For who are so free as the sons of the wave.</p>
<p><strong>Heart of oak are our ships, heart of oak are our men.</strong><br />
<strong>We always are ready.  Steady, boys, steady</strong><br />
<strong>we’ll fight and we’ll conquer again and again</strong></p>
<p>Our worthy fore fathers, let's give them a cheer<br />
To climates unknown did courageously steer,<br />
Through oceans to deserts for freedom they came<br />
And dying bequeathed us their freedom and fame.</p>
<p>We never see our foes but we wish them to stay,<br />
They never see us but they wish us away.<br />
If they run, why we follow, and run them ashore,<br />
And if they won't fight us, we can do no more.</p>
