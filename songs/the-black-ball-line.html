<h1>The Black Ball Line</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Barefoot the Bootless</strong></em></p>
<p>I served me time in the black ball line<br />
<strong>To me way hey hey hurrahdo</strong><br />
In the black ball line I served me time<br />
<strong>Hurrah for the black ball line</strong></p>
<p>The black ball ships they are good and true<br />
They are the ships for me and you</p>
<p>Once there was a black ball ship<br />
That fourteen knots an hour could clip</p>
<p>You will surely find a rush gold mine<br />
Just take a trip on the black ball line</p>
<p>Just take a trip to liverpool<br />
To Liverpool that yankee school</p>
<p>The yankee sailors youâ€™ll see there<br />
With red topped boots and short cut hair</p>
