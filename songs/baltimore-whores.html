<h1>Baltimore Whores</h1>
<p>There were four old whores from Baltimore<br />
Drinking beer and wine.<br />
The topic of conversation was<br />
"Yours is smaller than mine."</p>
<p><strong>Roly, poly, tickle my hole-y,</strong><br />
<strong>Smell of my slimy slough.</strong><br />
<strong>Then drag your nuts across my guts,</strong><br />
<strong>I'm one of the whorey crew. </strong></p>
<p>The first old whore from Baltimore said,<br />
"Mine's as big as the air.<br />
The birds fly in, the birds fly out,<br />
And never touch a hair."</p>
<p>The second old whore from Baltimore said,<br />
"Mine's as big as the moon.<br />
The men jump in, the men jump out,<br />
And never touch the womb."</p>
<p>The third old whore from Baltimore said,<br />
"Mine's as big as the sea.<br />
The ships sail in, the ships sail out,<br />
And leave their rigging free."</p>
<p>The fourth old whore from Baltimore said,<br />
"Mine's the biggest of all.<br />
A man went up in the springtime,<br />
And didn't come out till fall."</p>
