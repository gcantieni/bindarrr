<h1>Finnegan’s Wake</h1>
<p><em><strong>Formerly in the Irish Packet</strong></em></p>
<p>Tim Finnegan lived in Walker Street<br />
A gentle Irishman, mighty odd<br />
He’d a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet<br />
And to rise in the world he carried a hod<br />
Tim had a sort of a tipplin’ way<br />
With the love of the liquor, poor Tim was born<br />
And to help him on with his work each day<br />
He’d a drop of the craythür every morn’</p>
<p><strong>Whack fol the da, now, dance to your partner</strong><br />
<strong>’Round the floor your trotters shake</strong><br />
<strong>Wasn't it the truth I tell you</strong><br />
<strong>Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake</strong></p>
<p>One morning Tim was rather full<br />
His head felt heavy, which made him shake<br />
He fell from the ladder and he broke his skull<br />
And they carried him home, his corpse to wake<br />
They rolled him up in a nice clean sheet<br />
And laid him out upon the bed<br />
With a gallon of whiskey at his feet<br />
And a barrel of porter at his head</p>
<p>His friends assembled at the wake<br />
And Mrs. Finnegan called for lunch<br />
First they brought in tea and cake<br />
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch<br />
Biddy O’Brien began to cry<br />
“Such a nice clean corpse did you ever see?<br />
Tim, mavournin, why did you die?”<br />
“Ah, hold your gob,” said Paddy McGee</p>
<p>Then Maggie O’Connor took up the job<br />
“O Biddy,” says she, “you’re wrong I’m sure”<br />
Biddy gave her a belt in the gob<br />
And left her sprawling on the floor<br />
Then the war did soon engage<br />
’Twas woman-to-woman and man-to-man<br />
Shillelagh law was all the rage<br />
And a row and a ruction soon began</p>
<p>Then Mickey Maloney raised his head<br />
When a gallon of whiskey flew at him<br />
It missed, and falling on the bed<br />
The liquor scattered over Tim!<br />
Tim revives, look how he rises<br />
Timothy rising from the bed<br />
“Whirl your whiskey ‘round like blazes,<br />
Thundering Christ, d’you think I’m dead?”</p>
