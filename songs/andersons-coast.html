<h1>Anderson’s Coast</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Barefoot the Bootless</strong></em></p>
<p>Old Bass Strait roars like some great millrace,<br />
<strong>And where are you, my Annie?</strong><br />
And the same moon shines on this lonely place,<br />
As shone one day on my Annie’s face.</p>
<p><strong>But Annie, dear, don’t wait for me,</strong><br />
<strong>I fear I shall not return to thee,</strong><br />
<strong>There’s nought to do but endure my fate,</strong><br />
<strong>And watch the moon, the lonely moon</strong><br />
<strong>Light the breakers on wild Bass Strait.</strong></p>
<p>We stole a vessel and all her gear,<br />
And from Van Dieman’s we north did steer,<br />
Till Bass Strait’s wild waves wrecked us here.</p>
<p>A mile inland as our path was laid<br />
We found a government stockade<br />
Long deserted but stoutly made</p>
<p>And somewhere west, Port Melbourne lies,<br />
Through swamps infested with snakes and flies,<br />
The fool who walks there, he surely dies.</p>
<p>We hail no ships though the time, it drags,<br />
Our chain gang walk and our government rags<br />
All mark us out as Van Dieman’s lags.</p>
<p>We fled the lash and the chafing chain,<br />
We fled hard labor and brutal pain,<br />
And here we are, and here remain.</p>
