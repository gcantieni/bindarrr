<h1>The Mary Ellen Carter</h1>
<p>She went down last October in a pouring driving rain.<br />
The skipper, he'd been drinking and the Mate, he felt no pain.<br />
Too close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow,<br />
And the Mary Ellen Carter settled low.<br />
There was just us five aboard her when she finally was awash.<br />
We'd worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost.<br />
And the groan she gave as she went down, it caused us to proclaim<br />
That the Mary Ellen Carter would rise again.</p>
<p>Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend.<br />
She gave twenty years of service, boys, but met her sorry end.<br />
But insurance paid the loss to us, so let her rest below.<br />
Then they laughed at us and said we had to go.<br />
Well we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock,<br />
For she's worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock.<br />
And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain<br />
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again.</p>
<p><strong>Rise again, rise again, that her name not be lost </strong><br />
<strong>To the knowledge of men</strong><br />
<strong>Those who loved her best and were with her ‘til the end</strong><br />
<strong>Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again</strong></p>
<p>All spring, now, we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend.<br />
Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends.<br />
Thank God it's only sixty feet and the currents here are slow,<br />
Or I'd never have the strength to go below.<br />
Well we've patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down.<br />
Put cables to her, 'fore and aft, and girded her around.<br />
Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain.<br />
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again.</p>
<p>For we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale.<br />
She'd saved our lives so many times, living through the gales,<br />
And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave—<br />
They won't be laughing in another day. . .<br />
And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow,<br />
With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go,<br />
Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain,<br />
And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again.</p>
<p><strong>Rise again, rise again — though your heart it be broken and life about to end </strong><br />
<strong>No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend; </strong><br />
<strong>Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again. [x2]</strong></p>
