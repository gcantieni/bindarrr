<h1>Friggin’ In The Riggin’</h1>
<p><strong>Friggin’ in the riggin’</strong><br />
<strong>Friggin’ in the riggin’</strong><br />
<strong>Friggin’ in the riggin’</strong><br />
<strong>There’s fuck all else to do.</strong></p>
<p>Twas on the good ship Venus,<br />
By God you should have seen us-<br />
The figurehead was a whore in bed<br />
And the mast a throbbing penis.</p>
<p>The Captain of that lugger<br />
Was known as a filthy bugger,<br />
Declared unfit to shovel shit<br />
From one pile to another.</p>
<p>The Captain’s daughter Charlotte<br />
By god she was a harlot<br />
At night her thighs were lily white<br />
By morning they were scarlet.</p>
<p>The Captain’s other daughter,<br />
Was swimming in the water,<br />
When peals of squeals revealed that eels<br />
Discovered her sexual quarter</p>
<p>The bosun’s name was Andy,<br />
By god he was a dandy<br />
We crushed his cock upon a rock<br />
For cumming in the brandy.</p>
<p>The cook his name was Freeman,<br />
And he was a dirty demon,<br />
And he fed the crew on menstrual stew<br />
And hymens fried in semen</p>
<p>And when we reached our station<br />
Through skillful navigation<br />
Our ship was sunk in a wave of spunk<br />
From too much masturbation.</p>
