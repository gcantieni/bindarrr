<h1>The Goodnight Song</h1>
<p><em><strong>Jim Boyes</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>So goodnight my friends, as the dawn comes pale</strong><br />
<strong>And the eastern wind brings the threat of gales</strong><br />
<strong>Keep a hold on hope through the darkest vale</strong><br />
<strong>And we’ll meet further on down the road</strong></p>
<p>I have travelled far from this island strand<br />
From the icy waste to the burning sand<br />
Ploughed the raging sea, seen the verdant land<br />
Been at home in a place far away</p>
<p>Many differences but much the same<br />
Though the ways are strange and have different names<br />
But a friendly face breaks a thousand chains<br />
And a smile breaks the lock on the door</p>
<p>We have joined in song, laughed a night away<br />
Swapped our tales of woe, kept the clouds at bay<br />
In the morning clear we’ll be on our way<br />
But we’ll meet further on down the road</p>
<p>So let's drink a health to good times gone by<br />
When our spirits soared and we touched the sky<br />
And we’ll bid farewell but not goodbye<br />
And we’ll meet further on down the road</p>
