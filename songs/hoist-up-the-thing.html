<h1>Hoist Up The Thing</h1>
<hr />
<p><em><strong>The Longest Johns</strong></em></p>
<p>Fresh out of college with grades straight from Hell<br />
I browsed for a trade at which I could excel<br />
An ad for a ship in need of some manning<br />
Men, sails, and purpose, but lacking a captain</p>
<p>What luck, says I, to find such good fortune<br />
A few white lies later, I ran down the pier<br />
Bought me a coat and a cutlass or two<br />
Jumped on the deck, and I yelled at the crew</p>
<p><strong>Hoist up the thing! Batten down the whatsit!</strong><br />
<strong>What's that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it!</strong><br />
<strong>Turn hard to port!</strong> <em>[That's not port?]</em> <strong>Now I've got it!</strong><br />
<strong>Trust me, I'm in control!</strong></p>
<p>I can't sing the shanties, it has to be said<br />
And all of that grog just goes right to my head<br />
Whale meat is gross, and I miss a girl's laugh<br />
Five weeks at sea, even Dave seems a catch!</p>
<p>We've hit icy waters, no land to be seen<br />
The food's getting low, and the beer has gone green<br />
There's murmurs of discontent under the deck<br />
If I don't act fast, it could be my neck!</p>
<p>So pull up the charts and those weird gold machines<br />
I see what it says, but no clue what it means!<br />
Just pull on some levers and yank on some chains<br />
Feign a bad back til' we've landed again</p>
<p><strong>Hoist up the thing! Batten down the whatsit!</strong><br />
<strong>What's that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it!</strong><br />
<strong>Turn hard to port!</strong> <em>[This is jail?]</em> <strong>Now I've got it!</strong><br />
<strong>Trust me, I'm in control!</strong></p>
<p>I’ll Tell Me Ma</p>
<p><em><strong>Formerly in the Irish Packet</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>I’ll tell me ma when I go home</strong><br />
<strong>The boys won’t leave the girls alone</strong><br />
<strong>They pulled my hair, they stole my comb</strong><br />
<strong>But that’s alright ’til I go home</strong><br />
<strong>She is handsome, she is pretty</strong><br />
<strong>She’s the belle of Belfast city</strong><br />
<strong>She’s a-courting, one two three</strong><br />
<strong>Please won’t you tell me who is she</strong></p>
<p>Albert Mooney says he loves her<br />
All the boys are fighting for her<br />
Knocking on the door, ringing on the bell<br />
Singing, “oh, my true love, are you well?”<br />
Out she comes now, watch her go<br />
Rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes<br />
Old Jenny Murphy says she’ll die<br />
If she don’t get the fellow with the roving eye</p>
<p>Oh the wind and the rain and the hail blow high<br />
And the snow comes a tumbling from the sky<br />
She’s as nice as apple pie<br />
And she’ll get her own lad by-and-by<br />
When she gets a lad of her own<br />
She won’t tell her ma when she comes home<br />
Let them all come as they will<br />
For it’s Albert Mooney she loves still</p>
