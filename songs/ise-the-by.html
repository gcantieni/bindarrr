<h1>I’se The B’y</h1>
<p>I’s the b’y that builds the boat<br />
And I’s the b’y that sails her<br />
I’s the b’y that catches the fish<br />
And takes ’em home to ’Lizer</p>
<p><strong>Hip your partner, Sally Tibbo</strong><br />
<strong>Hip your partner, Sally Brown</strong><br />
<strong>Fogo, Twillingate, Morton’s Harbour</strong><br />
<strong>All around the circle</strong></p>
<p>Sods and rinds to cover your flake<br />
Cake and tea for supper<br />
Codfish in the spring o’ the year<br />
Fried in maggoty butter</p>
<p>I don’t want your maggoty fish<br />
That’s no good for winter<br />
I could buy as good as that<br />
Down in Bonavista</p>
<p>I took ’Lizer to a dance<br />
And faith, but she could travel<br />
And every step that she did take<br />
Was up to her knees in gravel</p>
<p>Susan White, she’s out of sight<br />
Her petticoat wants a border<br />
Old Sam Oliver in the dark<br />
He kissed her in the corner</p>
