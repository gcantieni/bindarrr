<h1>P Stands For Paddy</h1>
<p>As went out one fine morning<br />
For to take a little walk<br />
I sat myself down by an old stone wall<br />
To hear two lovers talk.<br />
To hear two lovers talk, me love<br />
To hear what they might say<br />
That I might learn a little of love before I go away.</p>
<p><strong>And ‘P’ stands for Paddy, I suppose</strong><br />
<strong>‘J’ for my love John</strong><br />
<strong>And ‘W’ stands for false Willy-o</strong><br />
<strong>But Johnny is the fairest man.</strong><br />
<strong>Oh, Johnny is the fairest man, she cried</strong><br />
<strong>Johnny is the fairest man</strong><br />
<strong>Oh I don’t care what anybody says, for Johnny is the fairest man.</strong></p>
<p>Oh I won’t sit beside you, love,<br />
Not now or any other time<br />
For you, you love another pretty maid<br />
And your heart’s no longer mine.<br />
Your heart’s no longer mine, she cried<br />
You heart’s no longer mine<br />
For you, you love another pretty maid and your heart’s no longer mine.</p>
<p>Well I will climb a high high tree<br />
And rob a little bird’s nest<br />
And I will take whatever I can find<br />
To the arms I love the best.<br />
To the arms I love the best, she cried<br />
The arms I love the best<br />
Oh, I will take whatever I can find to the arms I love the best.</p>
