<h1>Red-Haired Mary</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>While going to the fair of Dingle<br />
One fine morning last July<br />
When going down the road before me<br />
A red-haired girl I chanced to spy</p>
<p>I went to her, said, "aye, young lady,<br />
My donkey he will carry two<br />
And seeing how you have no donkey<br />
To the Dingle fair I’ll ride with you"</p>
<p>Now when we reached the town of Dingle<br />
I took her hand to say goodbye<br />
When a tinker man stepped up beside me<br />
And he belted me in my left eye</p>
<p><strong>Keep your hands off red-haired Mary</strong><br />
<strong>Her and I will soon be wed</strong><br />
<strong>We’ll see the priest this very morning</strong><br />
<strong>Tonight we’ll lie in a marriage bed</strong></p>
<p>Now I was feeling kinda peevish<br />
And me poor old eye was sad and sore<br />
And I gently tapped him with my hobnails<br />
And he flew back through Murphy’s door</p>
<p>A policeman came around the corner<br />
And he told me I had broke the law<br />
When the donkey kicked him in the kneecap<br />
And he fell down and broke his jaw</p>
<p>Then he went off to find his brother<br />
The biggest man you ever did see<br />
He gently tapped me with his knuckles<br />
And I was minus two front teeth</p>
<p>Now the red-haired girl she kept on smiling<br />
"I’ll go with you, young man," she said<br />
"We’ll forget the priest this very morning<br />
And tonight we’ll lie in Murphy’s shed"</p>
<p><strong>Keep your hands off red-haired Mary</strong><br />
<strong>Her and I will soon be wed</strong><br />
<strong>We’ll forget the priest this very morning</strong><br />
<strong>Tonight we’ll lie in Murphy’s shed</strong></p>
<p>Now through the fair we rode together<br />
My black eye and her red hair<br />
Smiling gaily at the tinkers<br />
And my God we were a handsome pair!</p>
