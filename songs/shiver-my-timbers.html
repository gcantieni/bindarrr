<h1>Shiver My Timbers</h1>
<p>Muppet Treasure Island<br />
* *<br />
Shiver my timbers, shiver my soul<br />
<strong>Yo ho heave ho </strong><br />
There are men whose hearts are as black as coal<br />
<strong>Yo ho heave ho </strong></p>
<p>And they sailed their ship cross the ocean blue<br />
A blood-thirsty captain and a cut-throat crew<br />
It’s as dark a tale as was ever told<br />
Of the lust for treasure and the love of gold</p>
<p>Shiver my timbers, shiver my sides<br />
<strong>Yo ho heave ho</strong><br />
There are hungers as strong as the wind and tides<br />
<strong>Yo ho heave ho</strong></p>
<p>And those buccaneers drowned their sins in rum<br />
The devil himself would have to call them scum<br />
Every man aboard would have killed his mate<br />
For a bag of guineas or a piece of eight<br />
A piece of eight! A piece of eight! <em>five, six, seven, eight! </em><br />
* *<br />
Shiver my timbers, shiver my bones<br />
<strong>Yo ho heave ho</strong><br />
There are secrets that sleep with old Davy Jones<br />
<strong>Yo ho heave ho </strong></p>
<p>When the mainsail’s set and the anchor’s weighed<br />
There’s no turning back from any course that’s laid<br />
And when greed and villainy sail the sea<br />
You can bet your boots there’ll be <em>treachery…</em> <em>treachery… treachery... [1 beat] oooh!</em></p>
<p>Shiver my timbers, shiver my sails<br />
Dead men tell no tales</p>
