<h1>The North Sea Shoals</h1>
<p>From Tripple Nipple Jones</p>
<p>Come all you gallant fishermen that plough the stormy sea,<br />
The whole year round on the fishing grounds<br />
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,<br />
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes<br />
Where the herring shoals are found.</p>
<p>It's there you'll find the Norfolk boys and the lads from Peterhead,<br />
There's Buckie chiels and men from Shields,<br />
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,<br />
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes<br />
Where the herring shoals are found.</p>
<p>From Fraserborough and Aberdeen, from Whitby, Yarmouth Town,<br />
The fleet's away at the break of day<br />
To the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,<br />
To the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes<br />
Where the herring shoals are found.</p>
<p>It's off with a boiler full of steam and your engine spic and span<br />
To fish the grounds the North Sea round<br />
And fish and knolls and the North Sea Holes<br />
And try your luck at the North Shields Gut<br />
With a catch of a hundred cran.</p>
<p>No need to wait for the wind and tide, you're the master of the sea,<br />
Come calm or squall, just shoot and haul<br />
And fill the hold with the fish to be sold<br />
And steam ahead for the curing shed<br />
And the buyers on the Yarmouth quay.</p>
<p>Come all you gallant fishermen that plough the stormy sea,<br />
The whole year round on the fishing grounds<br />
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,<br />
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes<br />
Where the herring shoals are found.</p>
