<h1>Black Velvet Band</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>In a neat little town they call Belfast<br />
Apprenticed to trade I was bound<br />
And many an hour’s sweet happiness<br />
I spent in that neat little town<br />
’Til sad misfortune befell me<br />
And caused me to stray from the land<br />
Far away from my friends and relations<br />
To follow the black velvet band</p>
<p><strong>Her eyes they shone like the diamonds</strong><br />
<strong>You’d think she was queen of the land</strong><br />
<strong>And her hair hung over her shoulder</strong><br />
<strong>Tied up with a black velvet band</strong></p>
<p>When I was out strolling one evening<br />
Not meaning to go very far<br />
When I met with a frolicsome damsel<br />
She was plying her trade in a bar<br />
When a watch she took from a customer<br />
And slipped it right into my hand<br />
Then the law came and put me in prison<br />
Bad luck to the Black Velvet Band</p>
<p>Next morning before judge and jury<br />
At trial I had to appear<br />
The judge says to me, "me young fellow<br />
The case against you is quite clear<br />
And seven long years is your sentence<br />
You’re going to Van Diemen’s Land<br />
Far away from your friends and relations<br />
To follow the black velvet band"</p>
<p>So come all you jolly young fellows<br />
I’ll have you take warning by me<br />
Whenever you’re out on the liquor, me boys<br />
Beware of the pretty colleens<br />
They’ll fill you with whiskey and porter<br />
’Til you are not able to stand<br />
And the very next thing that you know, me lads<br />
You’ve landed in Van Diemen’s Land</p>
