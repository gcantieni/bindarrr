<h1>Excursion Around The Bay</h1>
<p><em><strong>Johnny Burke</strong></em></p>
<p>Well it was on this Monday morning and the day be calm and fine<br />
A harbour grace excursion with the boys who had the time<br />
And just before the sailor took the gangway from the pier<br />
I saw some fellow haul me wife aboard as a volunteer</p>
<p><strong>Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife cry,</strong><br />
<strong>Oh me, oh my, I think I'm gonna die!</strong><br />
<strong>Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife say,</strong><br />
<strong>"I wish I'd never taken this excursion around the bay"</strong></p>
<p>We had three hundred souls on board, oh what a splendid sight,<br />
Matt Strong in regimentals, to make our spirits bright;<br />
With meself being in the double, with the funny things they'd say,<br />
And they'd choke themselves from laughing, when they see us in the bay.</p>
<p>Now, me wife she got no better, she turned a sickly green,<br />
I gave her soap and candy, fat pork and gasoline;<br />
Castor-oil and sugar of candy, I rubbed hair-oil on her face,<br />
And they said she'd be a dandy, when she reaches Harbour Grace.</p>
<p>My wife she got no better, my wife, my darling dear,<br />
The screeches from her throat, you could hear in Carbonear;<br />
I searched every place in Harbour Grace, searched every store and shop,<br />
To get her something for the cure, or take her to the hop.</p>
<p>Oh, she died below the Brandies, as we were coming back,<br />
We buried her in the ocean, wrapped up in the Union Jack;<br />
And now I am a single man, in search of a pretty face,<br />
And the woman who says she'll have me, I'm off for Harbour Grace!</p>
