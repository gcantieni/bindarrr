<h1>Blow Ye Winds In The Morning</h1>
<p>â€˜Tis advertised in Boston, New York and Buffalo<br />
Five hundred brave Americans, A-whaling for to go, singing</p>
<p><strong>Blow, ye winds in the morning, blow, ye winds, high-ho!</strong><br />
<strong>Clear away your running gear, and blow, boys, blow!</strong></p>
<p>They send you to New Bedord, that famous whaling port,<br />
And give you to some land-sharks to board and fit you out.</p>
<p>They send you to a boarding-house, there for a time to dwell;<br />
The thieves they there are thicker than the other side of hell!</p>
<p>It's now we're out to sea, my boys, the wind comes on to blow;<br />
One half the watch is sick on deck, the other half below.</p>
<p>The cooper's at the vise-bench, a-making iron poles,<br />
And the mate's upon the main hatch a-cursing all our souls.</p>
<p>The Skipper's on the quarter-deck a-squinting at the sails,<br />
When up aloft the lookout sights a mighty school of whales.</p>
<p>Now we have got him turned up, we tow him alongside;<br />
We over with our blubber-hooks and rob him of his hide.</p>
<p>But now that our old ship is full and we don't give a damn,<br />
We'll bend on all our stu'nsails and sail for Yankee land.</p>
<p>When we get home, our ship made fast, and we get through our sailing,<br />
A winding glass around we'll pass and damn this blubber whaling!</p>
