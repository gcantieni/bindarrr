<h1>The Bonnie Ship the Diamond</h1>
<p>Transcribed by Meister Jaeger from The Watersons (1965)</p>
<p>The Diamond is a ship, me lads, for the Davis Strait she’s bound<br />
And the quay it is all garnished with the bonnie lassies round<br />
Captain Thompson gives the orders to sail the whole world wide<br />
Where the sun it never sets, me lads, nor darkness dims the sky</p>
<p><strong>And it’s cheer up, me lads, let your hearts never fail</strong><br />
<strong>For the bonnie ship the Diamond goes a-fishin’ for the whale</strong></p>
<p>Along the quay at Peterhead where the lassies stand around<br />
With their shawls all pulled about them and the salt tears running down<br />
Now don’t you weep my bonnie lass, though we leave you behind<br />
For the rose will grow on Greenland’s banks before we change our mind</p>
<p>Here’s a health to the <em>Resolution</em>, likewise the <em>Eliza Swan</em><br />
Here’s a health to the <em>Battler of the Montrose</em> (NOTE: This probably refers to the Battler of Leigh. See below.) and the <em>Diamond</em>, ship of fame (NOTE: According to http://mainlynorfolk.info/lloyd/songs/thebonnyshipthediamond.html, this ballad was written only a few years before all the ships mentioned here (except the Eliza Swan) were destroyed in a whaling expedition.)<br />
We wear the trousers of the white and the jackets of the blue<br />
When we come home to Peterhead, we’ll have sweethearts in you</p>
<p>It will be bright both day and night when the Greenland lads come home<br />
With a ship that’s full of oil, me lads, and money of our own<br />
We’ll make the cradles for to rock and the blankets for to tear<br />
And every lass in Peterhead sings "Hushabye, my dear"</p>
