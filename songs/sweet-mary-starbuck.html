<h1>Sweet Mary Starbuck</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Meister Jaeger</strong></em></p>
<p>I married John Coffin just two years ago<br />
And he’s a fine man, as all Nantucket knows<br />
And he’s bound to make second mate, or so I hear<br />
If the Charles brings home enough oil next year<br />
At twenty a mother, at nineteen a bride<br />
With a child on my knee and another inside<br />
My heart it was broken, and swept out to sea<br />
Where my sweet Mary found it and brought it to me</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Mary Starbuck from Nantucket town</strong><br />
<strong>If she were the sea I would willingly drown</strong><br />
<strong>And her voice like a bell on a clear winter’s day</strong><br />
<strong>Sets my heart a-ringing and winging away</strong></p>
<p>At meeting one morning she came to me there<br />
With the Nantucket wind in her flyaway hair<br />
Her hand, soft and certain, clasped mine in the lane<br />
And I felt my heart shiver when she spoke my name<br />
Her words came in whispers, in trembling lines<br />
Her cheeks red as roses, her eyes all a-shine<br />
Then she kissed me so gently, so soft and so sure<br />
The world spun round once, and at once I was hers</p>
<p>On Nantucket our men go to hunt for the whale<br />
And they live at the mercy of teeth, sea, and gale<br />
But in town life goes on, and it goes on apace<br />
With children, and letters, and Mary’s sweet face<br />
So when John comes I’ll give him a kiss and a smile<br />
And a good whaleman’s wife I will be for a while<br />
And in time I’ll stand watching his sail fade at sea<br />
Then go home where my true love lies waiting for me</p>
