<h1>Shoals Of Herring</h1>
<p><em><strong>Ewan McColl</strong></em></p>
<p>With our nets and gear we’re faring<br />
On the wild and wasteful ocean<br />
It’s there on the deep that we harvest and reap our bread<br />
As we hunt the bonny shoals of herring</p>
<p>It was on a fair and a pleasant day<br />
Out of Yarmouth harbor I was faring<br />
As a cabin boy on a sailing lugger<br />
For to hunt the bonny shoals of herring</p>
<p>Now the work was hard and the hours were long<br />
And the treatment sure it took some bearing<br />
There was little kindness and the kicks were many<br />
As we hunted for the shoals of herring</p>
<p>Oh we left the home grounds in the month of June<br />
And for canny Shiels we soon were bearing<br />
With a hundred cran of the silver darlings<br />
That we’d taken from the shoals of herring</p>
<p>Oh we fished the Swarth and the Broken Bank<br />
I was a cook and I’d a quarter’s sharing<br />
And I used to sleep standing on me feet<br />
And I’d dream about the shoals of herring</p>
<p>Now you’re up on deck, you’re a fisherman<br />
You can swear and show a manly bearing<br />
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows<br />
While you’re following the shoals of herring</p>
<p>In the stormy seas and the living gales<br />
Just to earn the gear that I was wearing<br />
Sailed ten thousand miles, caught ten million fishes<br />
We was out there hunting shoals of herring</p>
<p>And it’s night and day we’re faring<br />
Come winter wave or winter gale<br />
Sweating or cold; growing up, growing old [and dying]<br />
As we hunt the bonnie shoals of herring</p>
