<h1>Bold Privateer</h1>
<p>Oh my dearest Molly, it's you and I must part<br />
I'm across the ocean, love - I'll leave you with my heart<br />
My ship is now awaiting, so fare thee well my dear<br />
I'm going onboard the vessel a bold privateer</p>
<p><strong>Bold privateer, bold privateer</strong><br />
<strong>I'm just now going onboard the bold privateer</strong></p>
<p>Oh my dearest Johnny, great dangers have been wrought,<br />
And many's a sweet life on the sea has been lost<br />
Better stay at home with your charming Molly dear<br />
Then to venture your sweet life a bold privateer</p>
<p><strong>Bold privateer, bold privateer</strong><br />
<strong>Then to venture your sweet life a bold privateer</strong></p>
<p>Oh my dearest Molly, your friends do me despise,<br />
Besides you have two brothers who'd freely take my life<br />
Come change your ring with me, dear love, come change your ring with me,<br />
And let it be a token when I'm across the sea</p>
<p><strong>When I'm across the sea, when I'm across the sea</strong><br />
<strong>And let it be a token when I'm across the sea.</strong></p>
<p>And when the war is ended, should heaven spare my life<br />
I'll return again to my intended wife<br />
And then I'll get married to my charming Molly dear<br />
And forever bid adieu to the bold privateer</p>
<p><strong>Bold privateer, bold privateer</strong><br />
<strong>And forever bid adieu to the bold privateer.</strong></p>
