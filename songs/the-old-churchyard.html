<h1>The Old Churchyard</h1>
<p><em><strong>From The Watersonsâ€™ 2002 album A Dark Light</strong></em></p>
<p>Come, come with me out to the old churchyard,<br />
I so well know those paths 'neath the soft green sward.<br />
Friends slumber in there that we want to regard;<br />
We will trace out their names in the old churchyard.</p>
<p>Mourn not for them, their trials are o'er,<br />
And why weep for those who will weep no more?<br />
For sweet is their sleep, though cold and hard<br />
Their pillows may be in the old churchyard.</p>
<p>I know that it's vain when our friends depart<br />
To breathe kind words to a broken heart;<br />
And I know that the joy of life is marred<br />
When we follow lost friends to the old churchyard.</p>
<p>But were I at rest 'neath yonder tree,<br />
Oh, why would you weep, my friends, for me?<br />
I'm so weary, so wayworn, why would you retard<br />
The peace I seek is in the old churchyard?</p>
<p>Why weep for me, for I'm anxious to go<br />
To that haven of rest where no tears ever flow;<br />
And I fear not to enter that dark lonely tomb<br />
Where our saviour has lain and conquered the gloom.</p>
<p>I rest in the hope that one bright day<br />
Sunshine will burst to these prisons of clay,<br />
And old Gabriel's trumpet and voice of the Lord<br />
Will wake up the dead in the old churchyard.</p>
