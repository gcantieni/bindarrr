<h1>Wild Goose</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Barefoot the Bootless</strong></em></p>
<p>Did you ever see a wild goose sailing o’er the ocean?<br />
<strong>Ranzo, Ranzo, way-hey!</strong><br />
They’re just like them pretty girls when they gets the notion.<br />
<strong>Ranzo, Ranzo, way-hey!</strong></p>
<p>The other morning I was walking by the river<br />
When I saw a young girl walking with her topsails all a-quiver.</p>
<p>I said, “Pretty fair maid, and how are you this morning?”<br />
She said, “None the better for the seeing of you.”</p>
<p>Did you ever see a wild goose sailing o’er the ocean?<br />
They’re just like them pretty girls when they gets the notion.</p>
