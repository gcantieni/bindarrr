<h1>The Scotsman</h1>
<p>From Whiskey Richards</p>
<p>Well a Scotsman clad in kilt left the bar one evening fair<br />
One could tell by how he walked that he'd drunk more than his share<br />
He fumbled round until he could no longer keep his feet<br />
<strong>Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ring-ding-did-a-little-la-di-oh, Ring-di-diddly-eye-oh,<br />
He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street</strong></p>
<p>About that time two young n' lovely girls just happened by<br />
One says to the other with a twinkle in her eye<br />
"See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built,<br />
<strong>I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt."</strong></p>
<p>They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be<br />
Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see<br />
And there behold for them to view beneath his Scottish skirt<br />
<strong>Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth</strong></p>
<p>They marveled for a moment then one said, "We must be gone.<br />
Let's leave a present for our friend before we move along."<br />
As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow<br />
<strong>Around the bonnie star the Scot's kilt did lift and show.</strong></p>
<p>Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards the trees<br />
Behind a bush he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he sees<br />
And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes<br />
<strong>"Lad I don't know you've been but I see you won first prize."</strong></p>
