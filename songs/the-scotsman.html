<h1>The Scotsman</h1>
<p><em><strong>Mike Cross</strong></em></p>
<p>Well a Scotsman clad in kilt left a bar on evening fair<br />
And one could tell by how we walked that he drunk more than his share<br />
He fumbled round until he could no longer keep his feet<br />
<strong>Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ring ding diddle diddle i de o ring di diddly i o</strong><br />
<strong>He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.</strong></p>
<p>About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by<br />
And one says to the other with a twinkle in her eye<br />
See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built<br />
<strong>I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt.</strong></p>
<p>They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be<br />
Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see<br />
And there behold, for them to see, beneath his Scottish skirt<br />
<strong>Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth.</strong></p>
<p>They marveled for a moment, then one said we must be gone<br />
Let's leave a present for our friend, before we move along<br />
As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon, tied into a bow<br />
<strong>Around the bonnie star, the Scots kilt did lift and show.</strong></p>
<p>Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards a tree<br />
Behind a bush, he lift his kilt and gawks at what he sees<br />
And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes<br />
<strong>“O lad I don't know where you’ve been but I see you won first prize.”</strong></p>
<p>The Scotsman he was numb with drink and his head was spinning round<br />
He couldn’t get that ribbon off, so homeward he was bound<br />
His wife she caught a flash of blue as he took off his clothes<br />
<strong>And it piqued her curiosity as you might well suppose.</strong></p>
<p>Well then she asked that Scotsman where he’d been and what he’d done<br />
He said there was a contest at the pub and that he’d won<br />
She cried, “you did not show that thing in front of all those men?”<br />
<strong>“I did not show it all my love, just enough that I would win.”</strong></p>
