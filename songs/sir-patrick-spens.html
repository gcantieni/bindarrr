<h1>Sir Patrick Spens</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Corvis the Nightterror</strong></em></p>
<p>The king sits in Dumferling town<br />
Drinking the blood red wine<br />
"Where can I get a good Captain<br />
To sail this ship of mine?"<br />
Then up and spoke a sailor boy<br />
Sitting at the king's right knee<br />
"Sir Patrick Spens is the best Captain<br />
That ever sailed to sea"</p>
<p>The king he wrote a broad letter<br />
And he sealed it with his hand<br />
And sent it to Sir Patrick Spens<br />
Walking out on the strand<br />
To Norway, to Norway, to Norway<br />
To Norway or the foam<br />
With all my lords and finery<br />
To bring my new bride home</p>
<p>The first line that Sir Patrick read<br />
He gave a weary sigh<br />
The next line that Sir Patrick read<br />
A salt tear blinds his eye<br />
"Oh, who is it, oh, who is it<br />
Who told the king of me<br />
To set us out this time of year<br />
To sail across the sea?</p>
<p>But rest you well, my good men all<br />
Our ship must sail the morn<br />
With four and twenty noble lords<br />
Dressed up in silk so fine<br />
And four and twenty feather beds<br />
To lay their heads upon<br />
Away, away, we’ll all away<br />
To bring the king's bride home"</p>
<p>"I fear, I fear, My captain dear<br />
I fear we'll come to harm<br />
Last night I saw the new moon clear<br />
The old moon in her arm."<br />
"Oh be it fair, or be it foul<br />
Or be it deadly storm<br />
Oh, blow the wind where’er it will<br />
Our ship must sail the morn"</p>
<p>They hadn't sailed a day, a day<br />
A day but only one<br />
When loud and boisterous blew the wind<br />
And made the good ship moan<br />
They hadn't sailed a day, a day<br />
A day but only three<br />
When oh, the waves came o'er the side<br />
And rolled around their knees</p>
<p>They hadn't sailed a league, a league<br />
A league but only five<br />
When the anchor broke and the sails were torn<br />
And the ship began to rive<br />
They hadn't sailed a league, a league<br />
A league but only nine<br />
When oh, the waves came o'er the side<br />
Driving to their chins</p>
<p>"Who will climb the top mast high<br />
While I take helm in hand?<br />
Who will climb the top mast high<br />
To see if there be dry land?"<br />
"No shore, no shore, my Captain dear<br />
I haven't seen dry land<br />
But I have seen a lady fair<br />
With a comb and a glass in her hand"</p>
<p>"Come down, come down, you sailor boy<br />
I think you tarry long<br />
The salt sea’s in at my coat neck<br />
And out at my left arm<br />
Come down, come down, you sailor boy<br />
Tis here that we must die<br />
Our ship is torn at every side<br />
And now the sea comes in"</p>
<p>Loathe, loathe were those noble lords<br />
To wet their high-heeled shoes<br />
But long before the day was o’er<br />
Their hats, they swam above<br />
And many were the feathered beds<br />
That fluttered on the foam<br />
And many were those noble lords<br />
Who never did come home</p>
<p>It's fifty miles shore to shore<br />
And fifty fathoms deep<br />
And there lies good Sir Patrick Spens<br />
The lords all at his feet<br />
Long, long, may his lady look<br />
With a lantern in her hand<br />
Before she sees Sir Patrick Spens<br />
Come sailing home again</p>
