<h1>I’ll Tell Me Ma</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p><strong>I’ll tell me ma when I go home</strong><br />
<strong>The boys won’t leave the girls alone</strong><br />
<strong>They pulled my hair, they stole my comb</strong><br />
<strong>But that’s alright ’til I go home</strong><br />
<strong>She is handsome, she is pretty</strong><br />
<strong>She’s the belle of Belfast city</strong><br />
<strong>She’s a-courting, one two three</strong><br />
<strong>Please won’t you tell me who is she</strong></p>
<p>Albert Mooney says he loves her<br />
All the boys are fighting for her<br />
Knocking on the door, ringing on the bell<br />
Singing, "oh, my true love, are you well?"<br />
Out she comes now, white as snow<br />
Rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes<br />
Old Jenny Murphy says she’ll die<br />
If she don’t get the fellow with the roving eye</p>
<p>Oh the wind and the rain and the hail blow high<br />
And the snow comes a tumbling from the sky<br />
She’s as nice as apple pie<br />
And she’ll get her own lad by-and-by<br />
When she gets a lad of her own<br />
She won’t tell her ma when she comes home<br />
Let them all come as they will<br />
For it’s Albert Mooney she loves still</p>
