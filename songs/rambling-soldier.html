<h1>Rambling Soldier</h1>
<p>I am a soldier, I do say<br />
That rambles for promotion<br />
I’ve laid the French and the Spaniards low<br />
Some miles upon the ocean<br />
Come, now me jolly boys,<br />
I bid you all adieu<br />
No more to the wars will I go with you<br />
But I’ll ramble the country through and through<br />
And I’ll be a rambling solider</p>
<p>The King he has commanded me<br />
To range this country over<br />
From Woolwich up to Liverpool<br />
And from Plymouth back to Dover<br />
And in whatever town I went,<br />
To court all damsels I was bent,<br />
And to marry none was my intent,<br />
But live a rambling soldier.</p>
<p>And when these wars are at an end<br />
I’m not afraid to mention<br />
The King will hand me my discharge,<br />
A guinea and a pension<br />
No doubt some lassies will me blame<br />
But none of them will know my name<br />
And if you want to know the same<br />
My name is Rambling Soldier</p>
<p>… And they call me a rambling soldier</p>
