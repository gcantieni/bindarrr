<h1>The Ways Of Man</h1>
<p>The ways of man are passing strange<br />
He buys his freedom and he counts his change<br />
Then he lets the wind his days arrange<br />
And he calls the tide his master</p>
<p><strong>Oh the days, oh the days</strong><br />
<strong>Oh the fine long summer days</strong><br />
<strong>The fish come rolling in the bays</strong><br />
<strong>And he swore he'd never leave me</strong></p>
<p>But the days grow short and the year gets old<br />
And the fish won't stay where the water's cold<br />
And if they're going to fill the hold<br />
They've got to go offshore to find them</p>
<p>So they go outside on the raving deep<br />
And they pray the Lord their soul to keep<br />
But the waves will roll them all to sleep<br />
And the tide will be their keeper</p>
<p><strong>Oh the tide, oh the tide</strong><br />
<strong>Oh you dark and you bitter tide</strong><br />
<strong>If I can't have him by my side</strong><br />
<strong>I guess I have to leave him</strong></p>
<p>I gave you one, I gave you two<br />
The best that rotten old boat could do<br />
You wouldn't be happy till I gave you three<br />
But I'll be damned if you'll get me</p>
<p><strong>Oh the tide, oh the tide,</strong><br />
<strong>Oh you dark and you bitter tide</strong><br />
<strong>If I can't have him by my side</strong><br />
<strong>The water's welcome to him</strong></p>
<p>Oh Lord I know that the day will come<br />
When one less boat comes slogging home<br />
I don't mind knowing that he'll be the one<br />
But I can't spend my whole life praying</p>
<p>I gave you one, I gave you two<br />
The best that poor old boat could do<br />
You'd have it all before you're through<br />
Well I've got no more to give you</p>
