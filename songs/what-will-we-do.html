<h1>What Will We Do?</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Long-Hard Susan</strong></em></p>
<p>What will we do if we have no money?<br />
Oh true lovers, what will we do then?<br />
I will hall through the town for a hungry crown<br />
And we'll yodel it over again</p>
<p>What will we do if we marry a tinker?<br />
Oh true lovers, what will we do then?<br />
I will sell a tin can and walk on with me man<br />
And we'll yodel it over again</p>
<p>What will we do if we marry a soldier?<br />
Oh true lovers, what will we do then ?<br />
All me handle is gone and I will fight for the fun<br />
And we'll yodel it over again</p>
<p>What will we do if we have a young daughter?<br />
Oh true lovers, what will we do then?<br />
I will take her in hand and we'll walk on with me man<br />
And we'll yodel it over again</p>
<p>What will we do if we have no money?<br />
Oh true lovers, what will we do then?<br />
I will hall through the town for a hungry crown<br />
And we'll yodel it over again</p>
