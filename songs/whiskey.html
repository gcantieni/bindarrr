<h1>Whiskey</h1>
<p>Whiskey is the life of man, I’ll drink whiskey when I can<br />
<strong>Whiskey-o, Johnny-o </strong><br />
<strong>Rise her up from down below </strong></p>
<p><strong>Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey-o </strong><br />
<strong>Up aloft this yard must go </strong><br />
<strong>John rise her up from down below </strong></p>
<p>I like whiskey hot and strong, I’ll drink whiskey all day long…</p>
<p>I’ll drink it hot, I’ll drink it cold, I’ll drink it new, I’ll drink it old</p>
<p>Whiskey made me sell my coat, whiskey’s what keeps me afloat</p>
<p>Whiskey killed my sister Sue, whiskey killed my brother, too</p>
<p>If whiskey was a river and I was a duck, I'd dive to the bottom and never come up</p>
<p>I wish I knew where whiskey grew, I'd eat the leaves and the branches too</p>
<p>Whiskey made me fail my class, whiskey got me crappy ass</p>
<p>Some likes whiskey, some likes beer, I wish I had a barrel here</p>
<p>Whiskey caused an awkward pause</p>
<p>Whiskey made the bosun call "hang together, one and all"</p>
<p>Whiskey stole my brains away, one more pull and we’ll belay</p>
<p><em>[Only the captain or boatswain sings this line!]</em><br />
A glass of grog for every man and a barrel full <strong>for the shantyman</strong>!</p>
