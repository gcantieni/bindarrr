<h1>Ben Backstay</h1>
<p>Ben Backstay was our boatswain, a very merry boy <br />
For no one half so merrily, could pipe all hands ahoy <br />
And when unto his summons, we did not well attend <br />
No lad than he more merrily, could handle the rope’s end<br />
<strong>Could han-dle the rope’s end, could han-dle the rope’s end</strong></p>
<p><strong>Singing chip chow cherry chow fol de riddle idle ow</strong><br />
<strong>Chip chow cherry chow fol de riddle day (x2)</strong></p>
<p>While sailing once our Captain, who was a jolly dog<br />
Served out to all our company, a double share of grog <br />
Ben Backstay he got tipsy, all to his heart’s content <br />
And he being half seas over, boys, right overboard he went<br />
<strong>Right o-ver-board he went, right o-ver-board he went</strong></p>
<p>A shark was on the starboard bow, and sharks no man can stand  <br />
For they do grapple everything, just like your sharks on land <br />
We heaved Ben out some tackling, to give his life some hope  <br />
But as the shark bit his head off, so he couldn't see the rope<br />
<strong>So he could-n’t see the rope, he could-n’t see the rope</strong></p>
<p>Without his head his ghost appeared, all on the briny lake <br />
He piped all hands ahoy and cried, "Lads warning by me take <br />
By drinking grog I lost my life, and you my fate could meet <br />
So never mix your rum me lads, but always take them neat<br />
<strong>But al-ways take them neat, but al-ways take them neat</strong></p>
