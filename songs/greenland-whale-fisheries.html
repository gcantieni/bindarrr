<h1>Greenland Whale Fisheries</h1>
<p>They took us jolly sailor lads<br />
A-fishing for the whale<br />
In the year of our lord eighteen hundred and six<br />
Bound for Greenland we set sail</p>
<p>The lookout stood on the crosstrees high<br />
With a spyglass in his hand<br />
There's a whale, there's a whale, there's a whalefish, he cried<br />
And she blows at every span</p>
<p>The Captain stood on the quarter deck<br />
And a sod of a man was he<br />
Overhaul, overhaul, let your davit tackles fall<br />
And we'll launch them boats to sea</p>
<p>We stuck that whale and the line played out<br />
But she gave a flurry with her tail<br />
And the boat capsized, we lost seven of our men<br />
And we never caught that whale</p>
<p>Now the losing of seven fine seamen<br />
Oh it grieved our captain sore<br />
But the losing of that bloody sperm whale<br />
Oh it grieved him ten times more</p>
<p>Now Greenland is a horrid place<br />
Where us fisher-lads have to go<br />
Where the rose and the lily never bloom in Spring<br />
And there's only ice and snow</p>
