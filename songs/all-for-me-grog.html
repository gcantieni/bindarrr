<h1>All For Me Grog</h1>
<p><strong>It’s all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog </strong><br />
<strong>It’s all gone for beer and tobacco </strong><br />
<strong>Well I spent all me tin on the lassies drinking gin </strong><br />
<strong>And across the western ocean I must wander </strong></p>
<p>Where is me shirt, me noggy noggy shirt? / It’s…<br />
The collar’s all worn out and the front is kicked about<br />
And my tails are looking out for better weather</p>
<p>Where are me boots, me noggy noggy boots?<br />
They’ve all gone for beer and tobacco<br />
The leather’s all worn out and the soles are all worn out<br />
And my toes are looking out for better weather</p>
<p>Where is me bed, me noggy noggy bed? / It’s…<br />
I loant it to a whore and now it’s all a-wore<br />
And the springs are looking out for better weather</p>
<p>Where is me wench, me noggy noggy wench? / She’s…<br />
Her lips is all worn out and her front is kicked about<br />
And her tail is looking out for better weather</p>
<p>Where is me man, me noggy noggy man? / He’s…<br />
Well he spends all his time with the women and the wine<br />
So I think that I shall push him over yonder</p>
<p>Where is me whore, me noggy noggy whore? / She’s…<br />
It’s her I want to lay, but she says I cannot pay<br />
So my whore is looking out for richer sailors</p>
<p><strong>It’s all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog </strong><br />
<strong>It’s all gone for beer and tobacco </strong><br />
<strong>Well I spent all me loot in a house of ill repute </strong><br />
<strong>And I think that I shall go back there tomorrow </strong></p>
<p>Well I’m sick in the head, and I haven’t been to bed,<br />
Since first I came ashore with me plunder,<br />
I’ve seen centipedes and snakes, and I’m full of pains and aches,<br />
And I think that I shall push out over yonder</p>
<p>Well me money was a-spent, and so off to see we went,<br />
And the ocean looked like whiskey, ‘twas an omen,<br />
Well we set off for Cathay, but we washed up far away,<br />
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond</p>
