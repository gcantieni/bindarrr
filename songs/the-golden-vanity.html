<h1>The Golden Vanity</h1>
<p>There was a lofty ship and they put her out to sea<br />
And the name of the ship was the Golden Vanity<br />
And they sailed her on <strong>the lowland lowland low</strong><br />
<strong>And they sailed her on the lowland sea</strong></p>
<p>And she had not been sailing but two weeks or three<br />
When she was overtaken by a Turkish revelry<br />
As she sailed along the lowland lowland low...</p>
<p>Then boldly up spoke our little cabin boy<br />
Saying, What would you give me if the galley I destroy<br />
If I sink them in the lowland lowland low</p>
<p>To the man that them destroys, our captain then replied<br />
Five thousand pounds and my daughter for his bride<br />
If he'll sink them in the lowland lowland low</p>
<p>The boy he made ready and overboard went he<br />
And he swam to the side of the Turkish enemy<br />
As she lay along the lowlands lowlands low</p>
<p>And he had a brace and auger made for the use<br />
And he bored nine holes in her hull all at once<br />
As she lay along the lowland lowland low</p>
<p>And some were playing poker and some were playing dice<br />
And some were in their hammocks and the sea as cold as ice<br />
And the water rushed in and it dazzled to their eyes</p>
<p>He swam back to his ship and he beat upon the side<br />
Crying, Shipmates take me up for I'm wearied with the tide<br />
And I'm weary of the lowlands lowlands low</p>
<p>Well, I'll not pick you up, the captain then replied<br />
I'll shoot you, I'll drown you, I'll sink you in the tide<br />
I will sink you in the lowland lowland low</p>
<p>If it was not for the love that I bear for your men<br />
I'd do unto you as I did unto them<br />
I would sink you in the lowland lowland low</p>
<p>And the boy bowed his head and down sank he<br />
And he said farewell to the Golden Vanity<br />
As she lay along the lowland lowland low</p>
