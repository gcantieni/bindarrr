<h1>A-Rovin’</h1>
<p>In Amsterdam there lived a maid<br />
<strong>Mark well what I do say </strong><br />
In Amsterdam there lived a maid<br />
And she was mistress of her trade<br />
<strong>I’ll go no more a-rovin’ with you, fair maid</strong></p>
<p><strong>A-rovin’, a-rovin’, since rovin’s been my ru-i-n </strong><br />
<strong>I’ll go no more a-rovin’ with you, fair maid </strong></p>
<p>Her lips were red her eyes were brown…<br />
Her hair was black and hanging down…</p>
<p>These last ten months I’d been to sea<br />
And Hell, this gal looked good to me</p>
<p>I took this maid out for a walk<br />
And we had such a lovely talk</p>
<p>And on this walk on which we went<br />
She clearly gave me her consent</p>
<p>I took her hand within my own<br />
Said she, "It’s time that I was home"</p>
<p>I put my hand upon her knee<br />
Said she, "Young man, you’re rather free"</p>
<p>I put my hand around her waist<br />
Said she, "Young man, you’re in great haste"</p>
<p>I put my hand upon her thigh<br />
Said she, "Young man, you’re rather high"</p>
<p>I put my hand upon her breast<br />
We did the dance she does the best</p>
<p>But when me money all was spent<br />
’Twas off to sea I gladly went</p>
