<h1>The Sick Note</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Humpy Gussy the Lumpy Hussy</strong></em></p>
<p>Dear Sir, I write this note to you to tell you of me plight<br />
And at the time of writing, I am not a pretty sight;<br />
Me body is all black and blue, me face a deathly gray<br />
And I write this note to say why Paddy's not at work today</p>
<p>While working on the fourteenth floor some bricks I had to clear;<br />
Now, to throw them down from such a height, it was not a good idea<br />
The foreman wasn't very pleased, he being an awkward sod<br />
He said I'd have to cart them down the ladders in me hod</p>
<p>Now, clearing all these bricks by hand it was so very slow<br />
So I hoisted up a barrel and secured the rope below<br />
But in me haste to do the job I was too blind to see<br />
That a barrelful of building bricks was heavier than me</p>
<p>So when I untied the rope the barrel fell like lead<br />
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead<br />
Well, I shot up like a rocket till to my dismay I found<br />
That halfway up I met the bloody barrel coming down</p>
<p>Well, the barrel broke me shoulder as to the ground it sped<br />
And when I reached the top I banged the pulley with me head<br />
Well, I clung on tight though numb with shock from this almighty blow<br />
And the barrel spilled out half the bricks fourteen floors below</p>
<p>Now, when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor<br />
I then outweighed the barrel and so started down once more;<br />
Still clinging tightly to the rope, I sped towards the ground<br />
And of course once more I met the fucking barrel coming down</p>
<p>Well, when I landed upon the bricks, I thought I'd passed the worst<br />
When the barrel hit the pulley-wheel and then the bottom burst<br />
Well, a shower of bricks rained down on me, I hadn't got a hope<br />
As I lay there losing consciousness, I let go the bloody rope</p>
<p>The barrel then being heavier, it started down once more<br />
And landed right across me as I lay upon the floor<br />
Well, it broke three ribs and my left arm and I can only say<br />
That I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today</p>
