<h1>Roll Down</h1>
<p>Capstan Chantey by Peter Bellamy</p>
<p>Sweet ladies of Ply-mouth, we bid you good-bye,<br />
<strong>Roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down!</strong><br />
We will rock you and roll you again by and by,<br />
<strong>Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down</strong></p>
<p><strong>And we will roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down,</strong><br />
<strong>Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down!</strong></p>
<p>The anchor's away and the sails are unfurled,<br />
We're bound for to sail her halfway 'round the world,</p>
<p>In the deep Bay of Biscay the seas do run high,<br />
Them poor weary transports they'll wish they could die,</p>
<p>When the great southern whales on our quarter do spout,<br />
Them poor weary transports, they'll goggle and shout,</p>
<p>When at last we draw near to Australia's bold strand,<br />
Them poor weary transports, they'll long for the land,</p>
<p>Then, sweet ladies of Plymouth, we'll pay all your rent,<br />
And go roving no more till our money's all spent,</p>
