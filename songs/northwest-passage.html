<h1>Northwest Passage</h1>
<p>**<em>Stan Rogers</em> **</p>
<p><strong>Ah for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage[^17]</strong><br />
<strong>To find the hand of Franklin[^18] reaching for the Beaufort Sea</strong><br />
<strong>Tracing one warm line, through a land so wide and ravaged.[^19]</strong><br />
<strong>And make a Northwest Passage to the sea</strong></p>
<p>Westward through the Davis Strait ‘tis there ‘twas said to lie<br />
The sea route to the western coast for which so many died<br />
Come seeking gold and glory, leaving weathered broken bones<br />
And a long forgotten lonely cairn of stones</p>
<p>Three centuries thereafter, I take passage overland<br />
In the footsteps of brave Kelso[^20], where his sea of flowers began<br />
Watching cities rise before me, then behind me sink again<br />
This tardiest explorer driving hard across the plain</p>
<p>And through the night, behind the wheel, the mileage clicking west<br />
I think upon MacKenzie[^21], David Thompson[^22] and the rest<br />
Who cracked the mountain ramparts and did show a path for me<br />
To race the roaring Fraser to the sea</p>
<p>How then am I so different from the first men through this way?<br />
Like them I left a settled life, I threw it all away<br />
To seek a Northwest Passage at the call of many men<br />
To find there but the road back home again</p>
