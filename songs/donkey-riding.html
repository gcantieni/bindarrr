<h1>Donkey Riding</h1>
<p>Great Big Sea</p>
<p><strong>Way hey and away we go </strong><br />
<strong>Donkey riding, donkey riding </strong><br />
<strong>Way hey and away we go </strong><br />
<strong>Ridin' on a donkey. </strong></p>
<p>Was you ever in Quebec<br />
Launchin' timber on the deck?<br />
Where ya break yer bleedin' neck<br />
Ridin' on a donkey!</p>
<p><strong>Way hey and away we goâ€¦</strong></p>
<p>Was you ever 'round Cape Horn<br />
Where the weather's never warm?<br />
Wished to God you'd never been born<br />
Ridin' on a donkey.</p>
<p>Was you ever in Miramichi<br />
Where ye tie up to a tree,<br />
An' the girls sit on yer knee?<br />
Ridin' on a donkey</p>
<p>Was you ever in Fortune Bay<br />
See the girls all shout, "Hooray!"?<br />
"Here comes dad with ten weeks pay<br />
Riding on a donkey."</p>
<p>Was you ever in London-town<br />
See the King he does come down?<br />
<em>See the King in his golden crown! </em><br />
Riding on a donkey</p>
