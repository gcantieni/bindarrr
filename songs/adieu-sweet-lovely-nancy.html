<h1>Adieu, Sweet Lovely Nancy</h1>
<p>Adieu, sweet lovely Nancy, ten thousand times adieu<br />
I’m going across the ocean, love, to seek for something new.<br />
Come change your ring with me, dear girl, come change your ring with me<br />
That it might be a token of true love while I am on the sea.</p>
<p>And when I am across the sea, you’ll know not where I am.<br />
Kind letters I will write to you from every foreign land.<br />
The secrets of your heart, dear girl, are the best of my good will,<br />
And let my body be where it might, my heart is with you still.</p>
<p>There’s a heavy storm a-rising; see how it gathers ‘round<br />
While we poor souls on the ocean wide are fighting for the crown.<br />
Our officers commanding us and them we must obey<br />
Expecting every moment for to get cast away.[^1]</p>
<p>There are tinkers, tailors, and shoemakers, lie snoring fast asleep<br />
While we poor souls on the ocean wide are plowing up the deep.<br />
There’s nothing to protect us, love, or to keep us from the cold<br />
On the ocean wide where we must bide, like jolly seamen bold.</p>
<p>But when these wars are over there’ll be peace on every shore.<br />
We’ll return to our wives and our families and the girls that we adore.<br />
We’ll call for liquor merrily and we’ll spend our money free,<br />
And when our money it is all gone, we will boldly go to sea.</p>
