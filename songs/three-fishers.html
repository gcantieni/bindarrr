<h1>Three Fishers</h1>
<p>Three fishers went sailing out into the west,<br />
Out into the west as the sun went down,<br />
Each thought on the woman that loved him the best,<br />
And the children stood watching them out of the town.</p>
<p><strong>For men must work and women must weep,</strong><br />
<strong>For there's little to earn and many to keep,</strong><br />
<strong>And the harbor bar be moaning,</strong><br />
<strong>The harbor bar be moaning.</strong></p>
<p>Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,<br />
They trimmed the lamps as the sun went down,<br />
And they looked at the squall and they looked at the shower,<br />
And the night-rack came rolling in, ragged and brown.</p>
<p><strong>For women</strong>** must work and ****men**** must weep,**<br />
<strong>Though storms be sudden and the waters be deep</strong><br />
<strong>And the harbor bar be moaning,</strong><br />
<strong>The harbor bar be moaning.</strong></p>
<p>Three corpses lay out on the shining sand,<br />
In the morning gleam as the tide went down,<br />
And the women were weeping and wringing their hands,<br />
For those who would never come back to the town.</p>
<p><strong>For we all</strong>** must work and ****we all**** must weep,**<br />
<strong>And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep</strong><br />
<strong>And good-bye to the bar and its moaning,</strong><br />
<strong>Good-bye to the bar and its moaning.</strong></p>
