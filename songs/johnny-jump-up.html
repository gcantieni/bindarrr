<h1>Johnny Jump Up</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>I’ll tell you a story that happened to me<br />
One day as I went down to Yule-by-the-Sea<br />
The sun it was bright and the day it was warm<br />
Says I, "a quiet pint wouldn’t do me no harm"<br />
I went in to the barman, I said "Give me a stout."<br />
Said the barman "I’m sorry, all the beer ‘tis sold out<br />
Try whiskey, try sherry, ten years in the wood"<br />
Says I, "I’ll try cider, I’ve heard that it’s good"</p>
<p><strong>Oh never, oh never, oh never again</strong><br />
<strong>If I live to a hundred or a hundred and ten</strong><br />
<strong>I fell to the ground and I couldn’t get up</strong><br />
<strong>After drinking a pint of that Johnny Jump Up</strong></p>
<p>After leaving the pub I went back to the yard<br />
When I bumped into Brolfy, the big civic guard<br />
"Come here to me, boy, don’t you know I’m the law"<br />
I upped with my fist and I shattered his jaw<br />
He fell to the ground with his knees doubled up<br />
But it wasn’t I’d hit him, ‘twas the Johnny Jump Up<br />
And the next man I met out in Yule-by-the-Sea<br />
Was an old man on crutches, and he said to me<br />
"I fear for me life I’ll be hit by a car<br />
Won’t you help me across to the railwaymans’ bar?"<br />
After a drinking a sip of that cider so sweet<br />
He threw down his crutches and danced in the street</p>
<p>I went down the Lee Road, a friend for to see<br />
They call it the madhouse in Cork-by-the-Lee<br />
And when I got up there, the truth I should tell<br />
They had the poor bugger locked up in his cell<br />
Said the guard testing him, "say these words if you can:<br />
‘Around the ragged rock, the ragged rascal ran’"<br />
"Tell them I’m not crazy, tell them I’m not mad<br />
It was only a drop of the creature I had"</p>
<p>A man died in the Union by the name of McNabb<br />
They washed him and laid him outside on a slab<br />
And after the coroner his measurements did take<br />
His wife took him home for a bloody fine wake<br />
‘Twas about twelve o’clock and the beer it was high<br />
The corpse he sat up, and he says with a sigh<br />
"I can’t get to Heaven, they won’t let me up<br />
’Til I bring them a pint of that Johnny Jump Up"</p>
