<h1>Retirement Song</h1>
<p><em><strong>The Longest Johns</strong></em></p>
<p>I've been roaming all my life and now I've found a lady wife, I'm staying, right here!<br />
Oh I won't go sailing any more I won't obey the ocean's call.  I'm staying, right here!</p>
<p><strong>I'll be a man of the land, I'll be a man of the trees</strong><br />
<strong>I'll be a man wherever my woman will be</strong><br />
<strong>I won't be any captain's mate. I won't be servant of the seas</strong><br />
<strong>'Cause this pretty little woman is all I need</strong></p>
<p>At 14 I was cabin boy to fearsome Captain Buckleroy. I'm staying, right here!<br />
When I was sick he ordered cat 'o nine, until I said that I felt fine. I'm staying, right here!</p>
<p>At 20 I manned our crow's nest and captain said I was the best. I'm staying right here!<br />
But I nearly lost my eyes to God just lookin' out for old Cape Cod. I'm staying right here!</p>
<p>At 25 no man alive could match my skill for gunnin'. I'm staying right here!<br />
But the Captain he got drunk one night and sank the blasted cannon. I'm staying right here!</p>
<p>Captain died at twenty eight and by then I was his first mate. I'm staying, right here!<br />
Well they tried to give me his command but I was hungry for the land. I'm staying, right here!</p>
<p>Stepped ashore at Felixstowe and made for Bristol by the road. I'm staying, right here!<br />
Well I fell in love when first I saw her. Avon County's finest daughter. And now she's got me staying right here (a-way!)</p>
