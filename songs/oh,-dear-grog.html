<h1>Oh, Dear Grog</h1>
<p>It’s of dear grog to you I’ll sing,<br />
And to dear grog I’ll always cling,<br />
I like my cup filled to the brim,<br />
And I’ll drink all you’d like to bring.</p>
<p><strong>And it’s oh, dear grog, thou art my darling, </strong><br />
<strong>And my joy both night and morning. </strong></p>
<p>If all the rest of Adam’s race<br />
Was assembled in this place,<br />
I’d part with all without one tear<br />
Before I’d part with you, my dear</p>
<p>The brewer brewed thee in his pan,<br />
The tapster drew thee in his can,<br />
Now I with thee will play my part,<br />
And lodge thee ever near my heart</p>
<p>And if my wife should me despise,<br />
By Jove, I’d pluck out both her eyes,<br />
But if she loved me as I love thee,<br />
A happy couple we would be</p>
<p>Though oft hast made my friends my foes,<br />
And oft hast made me pawn my clothes,<br />
But since thou art so near my nose,<br />
It’s up, me boys, and down she goes</p>
<p>Now since this liquor’s all drunk up,<br />
Methinks to you I’ll hand this cup,<br />
And when you’ve filled it up with sling,<br />
I’ll drink your health all ‘round again</p>
