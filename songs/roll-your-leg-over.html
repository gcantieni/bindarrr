<h1>Roll Your Leg Over</h1>
<p><strong>Roll your leg over</strong><br />
<strong>And roll your leg over</strong><br />
<strong>And roll your leg over</strong><br />
<strong>It’s better that way</strong></p>
<p>If all the young lassies were locks on a gate<br />
Then I’d be the key to insert and rotate</p>
<p>If all the young lassies were boats on the ocean<br />
Then I’d be the waves and I’d show ’em the motion</p>
<p>If all the young lassies were telephone poles<br />
Then I’d be the squirrel to crack nuts in their holes</p>
<p>If all the young lassies were sheep in the clover<br />
Then I’d ram and I’d ram and I’d ram ’em all over</p>
<p>If all the young lassies were winds of the sea<br />
Then I’d be a sail and I’d let them blow me</p>
<p>If all the young laddies were pipes in the yard<br />
Then after I drained ’em they’d still remain hard</p>
<p>If laddies were watches in shiny gold cases<br />
Then I’d be the hands and I’d sit on their faces</p>
<p>If all the young laddies were camels to pack<br />
I'd hump them all day, and I'd never spit back</p>
<p>If all the young laddies were coconuts sweet<br />
Then I’d suck out their juices and chew on their meat</p>
<p>If all the young laddies were needles and pins<br />
Then I’d be cushion to hold their pricks in</p>
<p>If all the young laddies were puppies full grown<br />
Then I’d be the ground where they’d bury their bone</p>
<p>If all the young laddies were singing this song<br />
It’d be over too quick and it’d be half as long</p>
