<h1>Leave Her, Johnny, Leave Her</h1>
<p>Oh the times are hard and the wages low<br />
<strong>Leave her, Johnny, leave her</strong><br />
But now once more ashore we’ll go<br />
<strong>And it’s time for us to leave her</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leave her, Johnny, leave her</strong><br />
<strong>Oh leave her, Johnny, leave her</strong><br />
<strong>For the voyage is done and the winds don’t blow</strong><br />
<strong>And it’s time for us to leave her</strong></p>
<p>The winds were foul and the work was hard....<br />
From the Liverpool dock to the London yard....</p>
<p>There was rotten meat and weev’ly bread<br />
You’d eat it or you’d starve to death</p>
<p>I hate to sail on this rotten tub<br />
No grog allowed and rotten grub</p>
<p>The skipper was bad but the mate was worse<br />
He’d blow you down with a spike and a curse</p>
<p>Oh the winds were hard and the water high<br />
She shipped it green and none went by</p>
<p>The sails are furled and the anchor is stowed<br />
And no more around Cape Horn we’ll go</p>
<p>I thought I heard the old man say<br />
You can go ashore and spend your pay</p>
<p>The rats have left, and we the crew<br />
It’s time, by Christ, that we did, too</p>
<p>We’ll make her fast and stow our gear<br />
The gals are a-waiting on the pier</p>
<p>Oh if ye can leave her like a man<br />
Then leave her, Johnny, while ye can</p>
