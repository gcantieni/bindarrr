<h1>The Crawl</h1>
<p>(from Sir Chauncey Bonnet, Esq.)</p>
<p><strong>Well, we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,<br />
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;<br />
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,<br />
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between.</strong></p>
<p>It all began one afternoon on the shores of Ambleside,<br />
We were sittin' there quite peacefully with the rising of the tide;<br />
When an idea it came to mind for to usher in the Fall,<br />
So we all agreed next Friday night we'd go out on the crawl.</p>
<p>We planned to have a gay old time, the cash we did not spare,<br />
We left all the cars at home and paid the taxi fare;<br />
I got out to Horseshoe Bay a little after five,<br />
From a table in the corner I heard familiar voices rise.</p>
<p>Spirits they ran high that night, old stories we did share,<br />
Of the days when we were younger men and never had a care;<br />
The beer flowed like a river and we drank the keg near dry,<br />
So we drained down all our glasses and were thirsty by-and-by.</p>
<p>Park Royal Hotel, The Rusty Gull, Square-Rigger and Queen's Cross,<br />
We'd started out with eight good boys but half had gotten lost;<br />
For you'll never keep the lads together when their eyes begin to rove,<br />
So there was just the three of us that made it to Deep Cove.</p>
<p>We arrived out at The Raven just in time for the last call,<br />
The final destination of this the first annual crawl;<br />
We dug deep into our pockets there was no money to be found,<br />
Nine miles home and for walking we are bound.</p>
