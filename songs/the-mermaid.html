<h1>The Mermaid</h1>
<p>**<em>Traditional. Additional verses by ARRR!!!</em> **</p>
<p>’Twas a Friday morn when we set sail and we were not far from the land<br />
When our captain, (s)he/they spied, a mer-i-maid so fair with a comb and a spyglass in her hand</p>
<p><strong>Oh the ocean waves do roll</strong><br />
<strong>And the stormy winds do blow</strong><br />
<strong>Aye, and we poor sailors are skipping at the top</strong><br />
<strong>And the landlubbers lie down, below, below, below</strong><br />
<strong>And the landlubbers lie down below</strong></p>
<p>Well up spoke the captain of our gallant ship, and a fine spoken (wo)man was (s)he/person were they<br />
“This fishy mermaid has warned me of our doom. We shall sink to the bottom of the sea”</p>
<p>Well up-spoke the mate of our gallant ship, and a dashing young (wo)man was (s)he/person were they<br />
(S)he says/they say “I have a wife, in Brooklyn by the sea, and to-night a widow she will be”</p>
<p>Well up-spoke the bo’suns of our gallant ship and the spawn of the devil were they<br />
They say “Man the capstan round boys, haul on the lines. You’ll work to the bottom of the sea”</p>
<p>Well up-spoke the cook of our gallant ship, and a greasy old butcher was (s)he/ were they<br />
(S)he says/they say “I care much more for my pots and my pans than I do for the bottom of the sea”</p>
<p>Well up-spoke the cabin boy of our gallant ship, and a wretched liddle cabin boy was (s)he/ were they<br />
(S)he says/they say “I left my fam’ly when I ran-away to sea, and to-night will they all grieve for me”</p>
<p>Well up-spoke the grog-masters of our gallant ship, and old dirty boozers were they<br />
They-say “Seal-me-in-a-cask for I’d much rather drown in me rum than sober in salt-sea”</p>
<p>Well up spoke the chaplain of our gallant ship, and a pale wizened codger was (s)he/ were they<br />
(S)he says/they say “You’ve-had your chance now, it’s too late to repent. Laughing at you-all from Heaven I will be”</p>
<p>Well up spoke the booty-master of our gallant ship, and a damn sly capital-ist was (s)he/ were they<br />
(S)he says/they say “Your deaths shall never settle in my books. In the next life you’re still in debt to me”</p>
<p>Well up spoke the look-out of our gallant ship, and a keen-eyed sentinel was (s)he/ were they<br />
(S)he says/they say “I’ve spotted whales and warships, but never mer i maids, who knows what in the next life I will see”</p>
<p>Well one time ’round spun our gallant ship, and two times ’round went she<br />
Then three times ’round spun our gallant ship and she sank to the bottom of the sea</p>
