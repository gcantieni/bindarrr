<h1>John Kamaka</h1>
<p>Additional verses by the crew</p>
<p>I thought I heard the Old Man say<br />
<strong>John Kamakamaka too-ri-ay </strong><br />
Today today is a holiday<br />
<strong>John Kamakamaka too-ri-ay </strong></p>
<p><strong>Too-ri-ay, oh too-ri-ay </strong><br />
<strong>John Kamakamaka too-ri-ay </strong></p>
<p>I thought I heard the boatswain say…<br />
There’s work tomorrow but no work today…</p>
<p>The boatswain says "Before I’m through<br />
You’ll curse your mother for having you"</p>
<p>There’s rotten meat and weev’ly bread<br />
Just like the Gate the Old Man said</p>
<p>She would not steer and she would not stay<br />
She shipped the water both night and day</p>
<p>We’re all Liverpool born and bred<br />
Strong in the arm but thick in the head</p>
<p>Growl ye may but go you must<br />
If you growl too loud your head they’ll bust</p>
<p>Around Cape Horn our ship must go<br />
Around Cape Horn through the ice and snow</p>
<p>My dear old mum she wrote to me<br />
Oh son, my son come home from sea</p>
<p>It’s one more pull and that will do<br />
And we’re the bullies to pull her through</p>
<p>Oh you don’t need a condom when you’re upper class<br />
‘Cause you can’t make a baby in the middle class’ ass<br />
<em>(Quarrels)</em></p>
<p>Oh you don’t need a condom when you’re with Whiskey<br />
‘Cause Whiskey just had a vasectomy<br />
(<em>Whiskey)</em></p>
