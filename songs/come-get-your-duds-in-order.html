<h1>Come Get Your Duds In Order</h1>
<p>Come get your duds in order, for we’re going to leave tomorrow<br />
<strong>Heave away, me jollies, heave away</strong><br />
Come get your duds in order, for we’re going to cross the water<br />
<strong>Heave away, me jolly boys, we’re all bound away</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we’re bound for Liverpool; sometimes we’re bound for Spain<br />
Sometimes we’re bound for St. Johns Town to watch the girls a-dancing</p>
<p>Now it's farewell Maggie darling for its now I’m going to leave you<br />
You promised me you’d marry me but how you did deceive me</p>
<p>I wrote me love a letter and I signed it with ring<br />
I wrote me love a letter; I was on the Jenny Lind</p>
<p>My love wrote me a letter as I sailed the great blue sea<br />
My love wrote me a letter she won't wait at home for me</p>
<p>In St. John's town we have good fun we watch the girls-a-dancing<br />
And when I've all drunk off all me glass you'll find me there a-prancing</p>
<p>Sometimes we’re bound for Liverpool, sometimes we’re bound for Spain<br />
But now we're bound for St. Johns Town to watch the girls a-dancing</p>
