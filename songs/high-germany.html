<h1>High Germany</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Lord Fjordinand the Firth</strong></em></p>
<p>“Oh Polly love, oh Polly, the rout has now begun<br />
And we must go a-marching at the beating of the drum<br />
Go dress yourself all in your best and come along with me<br />
I’ll take you to the war, me love, in High Germany.”</p>
<p>“Oh Willy love, oh Willy, come list what I do say<br />
My feet they are so tender, I cannot march away<br />
And besides, my dearest Willy, I am with child by thee<br />
Not fitted for the war, me love, in High Germany.”</p>
<p>“I’ll buy for you a horse, me love, and on it you shall ride<br />
And all my delight shall be in riding by your side<br />
We’ll stop at every alehouse and drink when we are dry<br />
We’ll be true to one another, get married by and by.”</p>
<p>Oh, cursed be them cruel wars whenever they should rise<br />
And out of Merry England press many a man likewise<br />
They pressed me true love from me, likewise my brothers three<br />
And sent them to the war, me love, in High Germany.</p>
<p>Me friends I do not value nor me foes I do not fear,<br />
Now my love has left me I wander far and near<br />
And when me baby it is born and smiling on my knee<br />
I’ll think of lovely Willy in High Germany.</p>
<p>“Oh Polly love, oh Polly, the rout has now begun<br />
And we must go a-marching at the beating of the drum<br />
Go dress yourself all in your best and come along with me<br />
I’ll take you to the war, me love, in High Germany.”</p>
