<h1>Wild Rover</h1>
<p><em><strong>Formerly in the Irish Packet</strong></em></p>
<p>I've played the Wild Rover for many a year<br />
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer<br />
But now I'm returning with gold in great store<br />
And I never will play the Wild Rover no more.</p>
<p><strong>And it's no, nay, never</strong> <em>[hike up your kilt]</em><br />
<strong>No nay never no more</strong><br />
<strong>Will I play the Wild Rover</strong><br />
<strong>No never, no more.</strong></p>
<p>I went to an alehouse I used to frequent<br />
And I told the landlady me money was spent<br />
I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay,"<br />
“Such custom as yours I could have any day!"</p>
<p>I took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright<br />
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight<br />
She said, "I have whiskeys, and wines of the best,<br />
And the words that I told you was only in jest!"</p>
<p>I’ll return to my parents, confess what I’ve done<br />
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son<br />
And when they forgive me, as oft' times before<br />
Then I never will play the Wild Rover no more.</p>
