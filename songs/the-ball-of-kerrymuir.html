<h1>The Ball Of Kerrymuir</h1>
<p>Four and twenty virgins came down from Inverness<br />
And when the ball was over there were four and twenty less!</p>
<p><strong>Singing balls to your partner; your ass against the wall</strong><br />
<strong>If you’ve never been had on a Saturday night, you’ve never been had at all.</strong></p>
<p>There was doin’ in the parlor, and doin’ on the stones<br />
You couldn’t hear the music for the wheezin’ and the moans</p>
<p>The village economist he was there, his prick held in his hand<br />
Waitin’ for the moment when supply would meet demand</p>
<p>The village postman he was there, but the poor man had the pox<br />
He couldn’t do the lassies, so he did the letter box</p>
<p>Anne Boleyn was also there, even though she’s dead<br />
She’s terrific on her back, me boys, but better giving head!</p>
<p>Pinocchio was also there, and quite a sight to see<br />
The ladies sat upon his face and shouted, “Lie to me!”</p>
<p>The village magician, he was there; he gave us all a laugh<br />
He pulled his foreskin over his head and vanished up his ass!</p>
