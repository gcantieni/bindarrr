<h1>Auld Triangle</h1>
<p>A hungry feeling came o'er me stealing<br />
And the mice were squealing in my prison cell</p>
<p><strong>And the old triangle went jingle jangle</strong><br />
<strong>All along the banks of the royal canal</strong></p>
<p>To begin the morning the screw was bawling<br />
"Get up, ya rascal, and clean up your cell"</p>
<p>The screw was peeping, Humpy Gussy was sleeping<br />
As I lay there dreaming of my girl, Sal</p>
<p>Up in the female prison there are seventy-five women<br />
And 'tis among them I wish I did dwell</p>
