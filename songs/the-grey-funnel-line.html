<h1>The Grey Funnel Line</h1>
<p>Ciril Tawney</p>
<p>Don’t mind the rain, nor the rolling sea<br />
The weary night never worries me<br />
But the hardest time in a sailor’s day<br />
Is to watch the sun as it dies away<br />
<strong>It’s one more day on the Grey Funnel Line </strong></p>
<p>The finest ship that sailed the sea<br />
Is still a prison for the likes of me<br />
But give me wings like Noah’s dove<br />
I’d fly up harbour to the girl I love…</p>
<p>Every time I gaze behind the screws<br />
Makes me long for old Peter’s shoes<br />
I’d walk on down that silver lane<br />
And take my love in my arms again</p>
<p>O Lord, if dreams were only real<br />
I’d have my hands on that wooden wheel<br />
And with all my heart I’d turn her ’round<br />
And tell the crew that we’re homeward bound</p>
<p>I’ll pass the time like some machine<br />
Until the blue water turns to green<br />
Then I’ll dance on down that walk ashore<br />
And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more</p>
