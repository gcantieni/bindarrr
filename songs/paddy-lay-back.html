<h1>Paddy Lay Back</h1>
<p>’Twas a cold a dreary morning in December <em>(December) </em><br />
An’ all of me money it was spent <em>(spent spent) </em><br />
Where it went to, Lord I can’t remember <em>(remember) </em><br />
So down to the shipping office I went <em>(went went) </em></p>
<p><strong>Paddy lay back </strong><em>(Paddy lay back!)</em>**_ _**<br />
<strong>Take in the slack</strong> <em>(Take in the slack!) </em><br />
<strong>Take a turn around the capstan heave a pawl </strong><em>(Heave a pawl!)</em>**_ _**<br />
<strong>About ship’s stations, boys, be handy </strong><em>(Be handy!)</em>**_ _**<br />
<strong>For we’re bound for Valipariso ’round the Horn </strong></p>
<p>That day there was a great demand for sailors<br />
For the colonies, for ’Frisco and for France<br />
So I shipped aboard a limey barque <em>The Hotspur </em><br />
And got paralytic drunk on my advance</p>
<p>I woke up in the morning sick and sore-o<br />
And I knew that I was outward bound again<br />
When I heard a voice a-bawling at the door-o<br />
"Lay aloft ye sods and answer to your names!"</p>
<p>’Twas on the quarter deck where first I saw ’em<br />
Such an ugly bunch I never seen before<br />
For there was a bum and stiff from every quarter<br />
And it made me poor old heart feel sick and sore</p>
<p>There was Spaniards and Dutchmen and Rooshians<br />
And Johnny Crappos just across from France <em>(Vive La France!)</em><br />
And most of ’em couldn’t speak a word of English<br />
But they answered to the name of "Month’s Advance"</p>
<p>I asked the mate a-which a-watch was mine-o<br />
Says he "I’ll soon pick out a-which is which"<br />
And he blowed me down and kicked me hard astern-o<br />
Calling me a lousy dirty son-of-a-bitch</p>
<p>So there I was a-once more out to sea boys<br />
The same ol’ bloody business o’er again<br />
Oh, stamp the capstan ’round and make some noise, boys<br />
And sing again this dear ol’ sweet refrain</p>
