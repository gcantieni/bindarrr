<h1>Glorious Ale</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Barefoot the Bootless</strong></em></p>
<p>When I was a young man my father did say,<br />
Summer is coming and it’s time to make hay.<br />
And when hay is carted don’t you never fail<br />
For to drink gaffer’s health in a pint of good ale.</p>
<p><strong>Ale, Ale, Glorious Ale,</strong><br />
<strong>Served up in pewter it tells its own tale.</strong><br />
<strong>Some folk like radishes, some curleye kale,</strong><br />
<strong>But give I boiled parsnips and a great dish of taters</strong><br />
<strong>And a lump of fatty bacon</strong><br />
<strong>And a pint of good ale</strong></p>
<p>Now our MP’s in parliament, our faith for to keep;<br />
I hope’s now we put him there, he won’t sit and sleep.<br />
But he’ll always get my vote if he never fail<br />
For to keep down the price of our good English ale.</p>
<p>Now take all teetotallers, who drink water neat,<br />
Well it must rot their gutses and give ’em damp feet.<br />
But I always say that a chap can’t grow stale<br />
On broad beans and bacon and a pint of good ale.</p>
