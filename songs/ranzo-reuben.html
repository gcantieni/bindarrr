<h1>Ranzo Reuben</h1>
<p><em>From Barefoot the Bootless</em></p>
<p>Oh Ranzo was no sailor<br />
<strong>Ranzo me boys, Ranzo</strong><br />
He shipped aboard a whaler<br />
<strong>Ranzo me boys, Ranzo</strong></p>
<p>He shipped with Captain Taylor<br />
The man who shot the sailor</p>
<p>He couldn’t do his duty<br />
So they gave him lashes thirty</p>
<p>The skipper’s daugher Suzy<br />
She begged her dad for mercy</p>
<p>She gave him wine and water<br />
And a little more than she ought’a</p>
<p>He got his first mate’s papers<br />
Now he’s Captain of a Whaler</p>
