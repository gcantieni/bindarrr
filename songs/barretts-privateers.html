<h1>Barrett's Privateers</h1>
<p><em><strong>Stan Rogers</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh, the year was 1778<br />
<strong>How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now</strong><br />
A letter of marque came from the king<br />
To the scummiest vessel I’d ever seen</p>
<p><strong>God damn them all!</strong><br />
<strong>I was told we’d cruise the seas for American gold</strong><br />
<strong>We’d fire no guns, shed no tears</strong><br />
<strong>Now I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier</strong><br />
<strong>The last of Barrett’s privateers</strong></p>
<p>Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town…<br />
For twenty brave men, all fishermen who<br />
Would make for him the Antelope’s crew</p>
<p>The Antelope’s sloop was a sickening sight...<br />
She’d a list to the port and her sails in rags<br />
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags</p>
<p>On the King’s birthday we put to sea...<br />
We were ninety-one days to Montego Bay<br />
Pumping like madmen all the way</p>
<p>On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again...<br />
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight<br />
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight</p>
<p>The Yankee lay low down with gold...<br />
She was broad and fat and loose in stays<br />
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days</p>
<p>Then at length we stood two cables away...<br />
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din<br />
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in</p>
<p>The Antelope shook and pitched on her side...<br />
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs<br />
And the main truck carried off both me legs</p>
<p>So here I lay in my twenty-third year...<br />
It’s been six years since we sailed away<br />
And I just made Halifax yesterday</p>
