<h1>The Boatmanâ€™s Cure</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Long-Hard Susan</strong></em></p>
<p>Poling up the <strong>river</strong> in a three-hand boat,<br />
Too deep to carry, too shallow to float,<br />
Too deep to carry, too shallow to float.<br />
<strong>If it doesn't lift your spirits it'll leave you numb</strong><br />
<strong>Best cure for the river is a bottle of rum,</strong><br />
<strong>Best cure for the river is a bottle of rum.</strong></p>
<p>Listen to the <strong>forwarder</strong> struttin' on the quay,<br />
He's quick to tell the boatman how the river will be.</p>
<p>Workin' up the rift the current swung her round,<br />
<strong>Bedbugs</strong> swum ashore, poor boatman nearly got drowned.</p>
<p>Sweatin' in the heat of day, chillin' in the rain,<br />
Sleepin' in the open got the <strong>ague</strong> again.</p>
<p>Frostbite in November took my toes away,<br />
Devil take the <strong>blackfly</strong> 'bout the last week in May.</p>
<p>Sweet Annie from Schenectady, she broke my heart, <strong>(heartbreak)</strong><br />
Her face is in the firelight, the river sings her part.</p>
<p>I fought all through this wilderness in '59<br />
Still fancy I see <strong>shadows</strong> moving most of the time.</p>
<p>Morning comes up early for a fast bateau,<br />
Shoulder to the setting pole, you push off and go.<br />
<strong>But there ain't no cure for living in a bottle of rum</strong>.</p>
