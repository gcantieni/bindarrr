<h1>Bound for Valparaiso in a Rowboat</h1>
<p><em><strong>Zeke Hoskin</strong></em></p>
<p>Windsor is a lovely port we're proud to sing about<br />
There's a warehouse full of whisky, though the Yankees do without<br />
And when Customs asks us where we're bound, we ship our oars and shout:<br />
"We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat"</p>
<p><strong>Pull your oars! <em>Pull your oars!</em> We're on our way! <em>We're on our way!</em></strong><br />
<strong>With a thousand quarts of whisky bound for Valparaiso Bay</strong><br />
<strong>And we haven't no intention for to see the U.S.A.</strong><br />
<strong>We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat</strong></p>
<p>Some say that for an ocean trip our craft is very small<br />
But we bold Canadian lads don't fear a little Cape Horn squall<br />
And a deep sea schooner's just too big to shoot Niagara Falls<br />
We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat</p>
<p>We've sailed for Valparaiso twenty seven times this week<br />
But every time we've gotten to the mouth of Muddy Creek<br />
We've had to jettison our cargo 'cause the oarlock sprung a leak<br />
We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat</p>
<p>Now some sing of Vancouver, of St John and Halifax<br />
But those salty water cities, they have nothing Windsor lacks<br />
We've a dory load of whisky and the muscles in our backs<br />
We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat</p>
