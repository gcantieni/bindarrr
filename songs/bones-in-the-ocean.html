<h1>Bones in the Ocean</h1>
<p><em><strong>The Longest Johns</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh, I bid farewell to the port and the land<br />
And I paddle away from New England's white sands<br />
To search for my long ago forgotten friends<br />
To search for the place I hear all sailors end</p>
<p><strong>As the souls of the dead fill the space of my mind</strong><br />
<strong>I'll search without sleeping 'til peace I can find</strong><br />
<strong>I fear not the weather, I fear not the sea</strong><br />
<strong>I remember the fallen, do they think of me?</strong><br />
<strong>When their bones in the ocean forever will be</strong></p>
<p>Plot a course to the night, to a place I once knew<br />
To a place where my hope died along with my crew<br />
So I swallow my grief and face life's final test<br />
To find promise of peace and the solace of rest</p>
<p><strong>As the souls of the dead fill the space of my ears</strong><br />
<strong>Their laughter like children, their beckoning cheers</strong><br />
<strong>My heart longs to join them, sing songs of the sea</strong><br />
<strong>I remember the fallen, do they think of me?</strong><br />
<strong>When their bones in the ocean forever will be</strong></p>
<p>When at last before my ghostly shipmates I stand<br />
I shed a small tear for my home upon land<br />
Though their eyes speak of deaths filled with struggle and strife<br />
Their smiles below say I don't owe them my life</p>
<p><strong>As the souls of the dead fill the space of my eyes</strong><br />
<strong>And my boat listed over and tried to capsize</strong><br />
<strong>I'm this far from drowning, this far from the sea</strong><br />
<strong>I remember the living, do they think of me?</strong><br />
<strong>When my bones in the ocean forever will be</strong></p>
<p>Now that I'm staring down at the darkest abyss<br />
I'm not sure what I want, but I don't think it's this<br />
As my comrades call to stand fast and forge on<br />
I make sail for the dawn 'til the darkness has gone</p>
<p><strong>As the souls of the dead live fore'er in my mind</strong><br />
<strong>As I live all the years that they left me behind</strong><br />
<strong>I'll stay on the shore but still gaze at the sea</strong><br />
<strong>I remember the fallen and they think of me</strong><br />
<strong>For our souls in the ocean together will be</strong></p>
