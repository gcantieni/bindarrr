<h1>Join the British Army</h1>
<p>From Tripple Nipple Jones and Smidge and Compass</p>
<p>When I was young, I used to be, as fine a man as ever you'd see<br />
The Prince of Wales, he said to me, "Come join the British army"</p>
<p><strong>Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, they're looking for monkeys up in the zoo </strong><br />
<strong>Says one, if I’d a face like you, I’d join the British army</strong></p>
<p>Sarah Comden baked a cake, it was all for poor Slattery's sake<br />
So I threw meself into the lake, pretending I was barmy</p>
<p><strong>Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, I’ve made me mind up what to do</strong><br />
<strong>So I’ll work my ticket home to you, and fuck the British army</strong></p>
<p>Seargent Healy went away, and his wife got in the family way<br />
And the only words that she could say were "Blame the British army"</p>
<p><strong>Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, me curse upon the labour crew</strong><br />
<strong>That took your darling boy from you to join the British army</strong></p>
<p>Corporal Sheen was a terrible lout, just give him a couple of pints of stout<br />
And he’d beat the enemy with his mouth, and save the British Army</p>
<p><strong>Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, I’ve made me mind up what to do</strong><br />
<strong>So I’ll work my ticket home to you, and fuck the British army</strong></p>
<p>When I was young, I used to be, as fine a man as ever you'd see<br />
The Prince of Wales, I says to he, "The hell with the British army!"</p>
<p><strong>Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, I’ve made me mind up what to do</strong><br />
<strong>So I’ll work my ticket home to you, and fuck the British army!</strong></p>
