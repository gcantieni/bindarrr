<h1>Eddystone Light</h1>
<p>My father was the keeper of the Eddystone light<br />
And he slept with a mermaid one fine night<br />
Out of this union there came three<br />
A porpoise and a porgy and the other was me!<br />
<strong>Yo ho ho, the wind blows free,</strong><br />
<strong>Oh for the life on the rolling sea</strong>*!*</p>
<p>One night, as I was a-trimming the glim<br />
Singing a verse from the evening hymn<br />
I heard a voice cry out "Ahoy!"<br />
And there was my mother, sitting on a buoy.</p>
<p>"Oh, what has become of my children three?"<br />
My mother then inquired of me.<br />
“One's on exhibit as a talking fish<br />
The other was served in a chafing dish.”</p>
<p>Then the phosphorus flashed in her seaweed hair.<br />
I looked again, and my mother wasn't there<br />
But her voice came angrily out of the night<br />
"To Hell with the keeper of the Eddystone Light!"</p>
