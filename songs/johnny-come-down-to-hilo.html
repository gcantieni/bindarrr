<h1>Johnny Come Down To Hilo</h1>
<p>Never seen the like since I been born<br />
An Arkansas farmer with his sea boots on<br />
<strong>Johnny come down to Hilo, poor old man </strong></p>
<p><strong>Wake her, shake her </strong><br />
<strong>Wake that gal with the blue dress on </strong><br />
<strong>Johnny come down to Hilo, poor old man </strong></p>
<p>I got a gal across the sea<br />
She’s a ’Badian beauty and she says to me…</p>
<p>Sally’s in the garden picking peas<br />
The hair on her head hanging down to her knees</p>
<p>My wife she died in Tennessee<br />
And they sent her jawbone back to me</p>
<p>I put that jawbone on the fence<br />
And I ain’t heard nothing but the jawbone since</p>
<p>So hand me down my riding cane<br />
I’m off to see Ms. Sarah Jane</p>
