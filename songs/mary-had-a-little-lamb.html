<h1>Mary Had A Little Lamb</h1>
<p>Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb<br />
Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow</p>
<p><strong>Hurrah for Mary, hurrah for the lamb</strong><br />
<strong>Hurrah for the Fenian boys who did not give a damn</strong><br />
<strong>And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go</strong><br />
<strong>Shouting the battle cry of freedom</strong></p>
<p>Mary had a little lamb, her father shot it dead<br />
Now Mary takes her lamb to school between two slabs of bread</p>
<p>Mary had a little lamb, it ran into a pylon<br />
Ten thousand volts went up its ass and turned its wool to nylon</p>
<p>Mary had a little sheep, she took that sheep with her to sleep,<br />
The sheep turned out to be a ram, now Mary has a little lamb!</p>
