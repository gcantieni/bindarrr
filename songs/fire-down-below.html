<h1>Fire Down Below</h1>
<p>From Tripple Nipple Jones</p>
<p>I'm just a simple country lad to London just come down<br />
To tell you the scrapes and narrow escapes I had when last in town.<br />
'Twas market day and I'd sold me hay<br />
And stood things to admire.<br />
When all at once a chap called out<br />
He'd mastermind the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Fire fire fire, fire down below.</strong><br />
<strong>Let's hope that we may never see a fire down below.</strong></p>
<p>I turned around to ask a lass the cause of all this stir,<br />
And if she'd mind as to be so kind as to tell me where it where.<br />
Said she "Young man, yes that I can,<br />
Do all that you inquire,<br />
So come with me, and you shall see,<br />
I'll take you where there's fire."</p>
<p>With that she linked her arm in mine and down the street she steered<br />
To some back slum she called her home but still no fire appeared.<br />
In a house we creeped, upstairs we peeped<br />
Three stories high and higher.<br />
In a room we stopped, all night we popped<br />
But I couldn't find the fire.</p>
<p>In the morning when I wakened up, my lady bird had flown.<br />
Not only lass, but all my brass, my watch my clothes were gone.<br />
Bare laggin' in feet, I ran in the street<br />
Me shirt me sole attire.<br />
The women all laughed, the men they chaffed<br />
But I kept callin' FIRE!</p>
<p>But some good chance, I made it home, half-dead with shame and fright,<br />
And all that saw and knew me well said, "Spoonie, served you right."<br />
But the worst wasn't past, it came at last,<br />
I thought I should expire.<br />
Say what you will I was very ill<br />
And the doctor said 'twas fire.</p>
<p>So come all you good gentleman, well courting have not been<br />
Be advised by me, don't foolish be, by all I've done and seen.<br />
Don't miss your ways on market days<br />
Or stand things to admire,<br />
But avoid back slums and female chums<br />
And don't go catching fire.</p>
<p>Fish in the Sea<br />
From Titan Triggerfish</p>
<p>Come all you young sailormen, listen to me<br />
I'll sing you a song of the fish in the sea,<br />
and it's...</p>
<p><strong>Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys</strong><br />
<strong>When the wind blows we're all together, boys</strong><br />
<strong>Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow</strong><br />
<strong>Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.</strong></p>
<p>Up jumps the eel with his slippery tail,<br />
Climbs up aloft and reefs the topsail,<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Then up jumps the shark with his nine rows of teeth<br />
Saying, 'You eat the dough boys, and I'll eat the beef!'<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Up jumps the lobster with his heavy claws,<br />
Bites the main boom right off by the jaws!<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Up jumps the halibut, lies flat on the deck<br />
He says, 'Mister Captain, don't step on my neck!'<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Up jumps the herring, the king of the sea,<br />
Saying, 'All other fishes, now you follow me!'<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Up jumps the codfish with his chuckle-head,<br />
He runs out up forward and throws out the lead!<br />
and it's...</p>
<p>Up jumps the whale, the largest of all,<br />
'If you want any wind, well, I'll blow ye a squall!'<br />
and it'sâ€¦</p>
