<h1>Randy Dandy-O</h1>
<p>From Tripple Nipple Jones</p>
<p>Now we are ready to head for the horn,<br />
<strong>Way, hey, roll an’ go!</strong><br />
Our boots and our clothes boys are all in the pawn,<br />
<strong>To me rollickin’ randy dandy-o!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heave a pawl,</strong> (NOTE: A ratcheting device on the capstan that prevented it from turning backward.)** oh, heave away,**<br />
<strong>Way, hey, roll an' go!</strong><br />
<strong>The anchor's on board an' the cable's all stored,</strong><br />
<strong>To me rollickin' randy dandy-o!</strong></p>
<p>Sing goodbye to Sally an' goodbye to Sue<br />
For we are the boy-os who can kick 'er through</p>
<p>Come breast the bars, bullies, an' heave her away<br />
Soon we'll be rollin' her 'way down the Bay</p>
<p>Roust 'er up, bullies, the wind's drawin' free<br />
So get on yer glad rags (NOTE: Best clothes or clothes used on special occasions) an' drive 'er to sea</p>
<p>We're outward bound for Valipo Bay,<br />
Get crackin', me lads, 'tis a hell of a way!</p>
