<h1>Blackthorn</h1>
<p>By Splinter-Eye</p>
<p><strong>Blackthorn, carry me home,</strong><br />
<strong>For it's down the hedgerows I will travel.</strong><br />
<strong>Blackened skin and poison thorns,</strong><br />
<strong>Blackthorn, carry me home.</strong><br />
<strong>Oh, blackthorn, carry me home.</strong></p>
<p>I went on the back roads and there did see<br />
There did see a rosary,<br />
A poor old mother on her hands and knees.<br />
Blackthorn, carry me home.</p>
<p>She wept on the ground where the bright sun shone.<br />
The bright sun shone, on and on.<br />
"I had three children, they are dead and gone."<br />
Blackthorn, carry me home.</p>
<p>I cut a branch of the poison thorns,<br />
Poison thorns like the devil's horns,<br />
A staff for to carry me 'til the morn.<br />
Blackthorn, carry me home.</p>
