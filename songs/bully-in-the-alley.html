<h1>Bully In The Alley</h1>
<p><strong>Help me, Bob, I’m bully in the alley</strong><br />
<strong>Way, hey, bully in the alley</strong><br />
<strong>Help me, Bob, I’m bully in the alley</strong><br />
<strong>Bully down in Shinbone Al’</strong></p>
<p>Well, Sally is the girl that I love dearly<br />
<strong>Way, hey, bully in the alley</strong><br />
Sally is the girl that I’d splice nearly<br />
<strong>Bully down in Shinbone Al’</strong></p>
<p>For seven long years I courted Sally…<br />
All she did was dilly in the dally…</p>
<p>I bought her silks, I bought her laces<br />
I took her out to all the fine places</p>
<p>Well, I’ll leave Sal and I’ll be a sailor<br />
I’ll leave Sal and ship aboard a whaler</p>
<p>When I get back I’ll marry Sally<br />
We’ll have kids and count them by the tally</p>
