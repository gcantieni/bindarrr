<h1>The Titanic</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Rabies the Regularly Bitten</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh, they built the great Titanic to sail the ocean blue,<br />
And they thought they had a ship that water’d never get through;<br />
But on its maiden trip, well, an iceberg struck the ship,<br />
<strong>It was sad when the great ship went down</strong> <em>[blub blub blub]</em></p>
<p><strong>Oh it was sad!</strong> <em>[so sad]</em><br />
<strong>It was sad,</strong> <em>[too bad]</em><br />
<strong>it was sad when the great ship went down,</strong> <em>[to the bottom of the…]</em><br />
<strong>husbands and wives, little children lost their lives</strong><br />
<strong>It was sad when the great ship went down</strong></p>
<p>They were not far from the shore, maybe a thousand miles or more<br />
When the rich refused to associate with the poor,<br />
They sent them down below, where they were the first to go,</p>
<p>The ship was full of sin and the sides were ‘bout to burst,<br />
When the captain shouted, “Women and children first!”<br />
The captain tried to wire, but the lines were all on fire,</p>
<p>They swung the lifeboats out o’er the dark and raging sea,<br />
As the band struck up <em>Nearer My God to Thee</em>,<br />
Little babies wept and cried, as the waves swept over side,</p>
<p>The captain stood on deck with a teardrop in his eye,<br />
As the last boat left he waved them all goodbye,<br />
But he knew he made a slip, so he went down with his ship,</p>
<p>The moral of the story, as you can plainly see<br />
Is to wear a life preserver, and never go out to sea<br />
‘Cause whether rich or poor, you’ll sink to the ocean floor!</p>
