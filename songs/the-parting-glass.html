<h1>The Parting Glass</h1>
<p><em><strong>Formerly in the Irish Packet</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh, all the money that e’er I spent, I spent it in good company<br />
And all the harm that e’er I’ve done, alas, it was to none but me<br />
And all I’ve done for want of wit to mem’ry now I can’t recall<br />
So fill to me the parting glass, good night and joy be with you all</p>
<p>Oh, all the comrades that e’er I’ve had, they are sorry for my going away<br />
And all the sweethearts that e’er I’ve had, would wish me one more day to stay<br />
But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not<br />
I’ll gently rise and I’ll softly call good night and joy be with you all<br />
Good night, and joy be with you all</p>
