<h1>The Rocky Road To Dublin</h1>
<p><em><strong>Formerly in the Irish Packet</strong></em></p>
<p>In the merry month of June from my home I started<br />
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken-hearted<br />
Saluted me Father dear, kissed me darlin’ Mother<br />
Drank a pint of beer, my grief and tears to smother<br />
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born<br />
I cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins<br />
Bought a pair of brogues, rattlin’ o’er the bogs<br />
And frightened all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin</p>
<p><strong>One, two, three, four, five!</strong><br />
<strong>Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road</strong><br />
<strong>All the way to Dublin, whack fol-lol-de-ra</strong></p>
<p>In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary<br />
Started by daylight next morning bright and airy<br />
Took a drop of the pure to keep my heart from sinking<br />
That’s the Paddy’s cure, whene’er he’s on for drinking<br />
To see the lassies smile, laughing all the while<br />
At my curious style, ’twould set your heart a-bubbling<br />
Asked if I was hired, wages I required<br />
’Till I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin</p>
<p>In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity<br />
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city<br />
So then I took a stroll out among the quality<br />
My bundle it was stolen in a neat locality<br />
Something crossed my mind, when I looked behind<br />
No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin’<br />
Enquiring for the rogue, found me Connaught brogue<br />
Wasn’t much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin</p>
<p>From there I got away, me spirits never failing<br />
Landed on the quay just as the ship was sailing<br />
The captain at me roared, said that no room had he<br />
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy<br />
Down among the pigs, played some funny rigs<br />
Danced some hearty jigs, the water ’round me bubbling<br />
When off Holyhead, wished meself was dead<br />
Or better far, instead, on the rocky road to Dublin</p>
<p>The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed<br />
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it<br />
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing<br />
Poor old Erin’s isle they began abusing<br />
“Hurrah me soul!” says I, shillelagh I let fly<br />
Some Galway boys were nigh, they saw I was a-hobblin’<br />
With a loud “Hurray!” they joined in the affray<br />
We quickly cleared the way, for the rocky road to Dublin</p>
