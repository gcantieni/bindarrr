<h1>Rosin the Beau</h1>
<p><em><strong>From The Whip! and Old Navy Jones</strong></em></p>
<p>I've traveled this wide world all over,<br />
And now to another I go.<br />
<strong>I know that good quarters are waiting</strong><br />
<strong>To welcome old Rosin the Beau.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To welcome old Rosin the Beau. (x2)</strong><br />
<strong>I know that good quarters are waiting</strong><br />
<strong>To welcome old Rosin the Beau.</strong></p>
<p>When I'm dead and laid out on the counter<br />
A voice you will hear from below,<br />
<strong>Saying "Send down a hogshead of whisky</strong><br />
<strong>To drink with old Rosin the Beau.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>Then get a half-dozen stout fellows<br />
And stack them all up in a row<br />
<strong>Let them drink out of half-gallon bottles</strong><br />
<strong>To the memory of Rosin the Beau</strong></p>
<p>Then get a half-dozen stout fellows<br />
And let them all stagger and go<br />
<strong>And dig a great hole in the meadow</strong><br />
<strong>And in it put Rosin the Beau.</strong></p>
<p>Then get ye a couple of bottles;<br />
Put one at me head and me toe.<br />
<strong>With a diamond ring scratch upon 'em</strong><br />
<strong>The name of old Rosin the Beau.</strong></p>
<p>I feel that old tyrant approaching,<br />
That cruel and remorseless old foe,<br />
<strong>And I lift up me glass in his honor,</strong><br />
<strong>Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau.</strong></p>
