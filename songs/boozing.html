<h1>Boozing</h1>
<p>Now what are the joys of a single young man?<br />
<strong>Why, boozing, bloody well boozing</strong><br />
And what is he doing whenever he can?<br />
<strong>Why, boozing, bloody well boozing</strong></p>
<p>You may think I’m wrong or you may think I’m right<br />
I’m not going to argue, I know you can’t fight<br />
But what do you think we are doing tonight?<br />
<strong>Why, boozing, bloody well boozing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Boozing, boozing, just you and I</strong><br />
<strong>Boozing, boozing, when we are dry</strong><br />
<strong>Some do it openly, some on the sly</strong><br />
<strong>And we all are bloody well boozing</strong></p>
<p>Oh what are the joys of an old married man? <strong>…</strong><br />
And what is he doing whenever he can? <strong>…</strong><br />
He comes home at night and he gives his wife all<br />
He goes out a-shopping, makes many a call<br />
But what brings him home hanging on to the wall? <strong>…</strong></p>
<p>And what do the moral majority run down? <strong>…</strong><br />
And what are they banning in every town? <strong>…</strong><br />
They stand on street corners, they rave and they shout<br />
They shout about things they know nothing about<br />
But what are they doing when the lights are turned out? <strong>…</strong></p>
