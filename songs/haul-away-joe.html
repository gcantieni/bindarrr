<h1>Haul Away Joe</h1>
<p>**<em>The first song ever sung by the crew in a show</em> **</p>
<p>When I was a little boy my mother always told me<br />
<strong>’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe</strong><br />
That if I did not kiss the girls my lips would grow all moldy<br />
<strong>’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe</strong></p>
<p>Once in my life I married a wife but she was mean and lazy…<br />
Then I met an Irish girl, she drives me crazy…</p>
<p><strong>’Way, haul away, we’re bound for better weather</strong><br />
<strong>’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe</strong></p>
<p>Once I was in Ireland, a-digging turf and taters<br />
But now I’m on a pirate ship, a-hauling on the braces</p>
<p>St. Patrick drove away the snakes, then drank up all the whiskey<br />
This made him sing and dance a jig, he felt so fine and frisky</p>
<p><strong>’Way, haul away, we’re bound for better weather</strong><br />
<strong>’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe</strong></p>
<p>You call yourself a second mate but you can’t tie a bowline<br />
You cannot even stand up straight when the ship is a-rolling</p>
<p>The cook is in the galley making duff so handy<br />
The captain’s in his cabin drinking wine and brandy</p>
<p><strong>’Way, haul away, the good ship is a-rolling</strong><br />
<strong>’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe</strong></p>
