<h1>Haul Away Joe</h1>
<p>The first song ever sung by the crew in a show</p>
<p>When I was a little boy my mother always told me<br />
<strong>’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe </strong><br />
That if I did not fuck the girls my prick would grow all moldy<br />
<strong>’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe </strong></p>
<p>Once in my life I married a wife but she was fat and lazy…<br />
Then I met an Irish girl, she damn near drove me crazy…</p>
<p><strong>’Way, haul away, we’re bound for better weather </strong><br />
<strong>’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe</strong></p>
<p>Once I was in Ireland, a-digging turf and taters<br />
But now I’m on a Limey (pirate) ship, a-hauling on the braces</p>
<p>St. Patrick drove away the snakes, then drank up all the whiskey<br />
This made him sing and dance a jig, he felt so fine and frisky</p>
<p><strong>’Way, haul away, we’re bound for better weather </strong><br />
<strong>’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe</strong></p>
<p>You call yourself a second mate but you can’t tie a bowline<br />
You cannot even stand up straight when the ship is a-rolling</p>
<p>The cook is in the galley making duff so handy<br />
The captain’s in his cabin drinking wine and brandy</p>
<p><strong>’Way, haul away, the good ship is a-rolling </strong><br />
<strong>’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe</strong></p>
