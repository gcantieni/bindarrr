<h1>Hills Of Connemara</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p><strong>Gather up the pots and the old tin cans</strong><br />
<strong>The mash, the corn, the barley and the bran,</strong><br />
<strong>Run like the devil from the excise man</strong><br />
<strong>Keep the smoke from rising, Barney.</strong></p>
<p>Keep your eyes well peeled today,<br />
The excise men are on their way,<br />
Searching for the mountain tay<br />
In the hills of Connemara.</p>
<p>Swinging to the left, swinging to the right<br />
The excise men will dance all night<br />
Drinkin’ up the tay till the broad daylight<br />
In the hills of Connemara</p>
<p>A gallon for the butcher and a quart for John<br />
And a bottle for poor old Father Tom<br />
To help the poor old dear along<br />
In the hills of Connemara</p>
<p>Stand your ground and don’t you fall<br />
The excise men are at the wall<br />
Jesus Christ! They’re drinkin’ it all!<br />
In the hills of Connemara</p>
