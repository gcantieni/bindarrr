<h1>Fiddler’s Green</h1>
<p>John Conolly</p>
<p><strong>Dress me up in me oilskins and jumper </strong><br />
<strong>No more on the docks I’ll be seen </strong><br />
<strong>Just tell me old shipmates I’m taking a trip, mates </strong><br />
<strong>And I’ll see you someday on Fiddler’s Green </strong></p>
<p>Oh, Fiddler’s Green is a place I’ve heard tell<br />
Where fishermen go if they don’t go to Hell<br />
Where the weather is fair and the dolphins do play<br />
And the cold coast of Greenland is far far away</p>
<p>Where the sky’s always blue and there’s never a gale<br />
Where the fish jump on board with a swish of their tails<br />
Where you lie at your leisure, there’s no work to do<br />
And the skipper’s below making tea for the crew</p>
<p>When you get back to dock and your long trip is through<br />
There’s pubs, and there’s clubs, and there’s lassies there, too<br />
The girls are all pretty and the beer is all free<br />
And there’s bottles of rum growing on every tree</p>
<p>Well I don’t want a harp nor a halo, not me<br />
Just give me a breeze and a good rolling sea<br />
And I’ll play me old squeezebox as we sail along<br />
With the wind in the rigging to sing me this song</p>
