<h1>Red is the Rose</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Chase the Wild Goose</strong></em></p>
<p>Come over the hills, my bonnie Irish lass<br />
Come over the hills to your darling<br />
You choose the road, love, and I'll make the vow<br />
And I'll be your true love forever</p>
<p><strong>Red is the rose that in yonder garden grows</strong><br />
<strong>Fair is the lily of the valley</strong><br />
<strong>Clear is the water that flows from the Boyne</strong><br />
<strong>But my love is fairer than any</strong></p>
<p>'Twas down by Killarney's green woods that we strayed<br />
When the moon and the stars they were shining<br />
The moon shone its rays on her locks of golden hair<br />
And she swore she'd be my love forever</p>
<p>It's not for the parting that my sister pains<br />
It's not for the grief of my mother<br />
It's all for the loss of my bonny Irish lass<br />
That my heart is breaking forever</p>
<p>Red is the rose that in yonder garden grows<br />
Fair is the lily of the valley<br />
Clear is the water that flows from the Boyne<br />
But my love is fairer than any</p>
