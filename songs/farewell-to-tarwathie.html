<h1>Farewell To Tarwathie</h1>
<p>Farewell to Tarwathie, adieu, Mormond Hill,<br />
And the dear land of Crimmond, I bid ye farewell;<br />
I'm bound out for Greenland and ready to sail,<br />
In hopes to find riches in hunting the whale.</p>
<p>Adieu to my comrades, for a while we must part,<br />
And likewise the dear lass, wha’ fair won my heart;<br />
The cold ice of Greenland, my love will not chill,<br />
And the longer our absence, more loving she'll feel.</p>
<p>Our ship is well rigged and she's ready to sail,<br />
Our crew they are anxious to follow the whale;<br />
Where the icebergs do float and the stormy winds blow,<br />
Where the land and the ocean are covered with snow.</p>
<p>Oh the cold coast of Greenland is barren and bare,<br />
No seed-time or harvest is ever known there;<br />
The birds here sing sweetly on mountain and dale,<br />
But there is na’ a birdie to sing to the whale.</p>
<p>There is no habitation, for a man to live there,<br />
And the king of that country is the fierce Greenland bear;<br />
And there'll be no temptation, to tarry long there,<br />
With our ship bumper full we will homeward repair</p>
