<h1>The Pirates Who Donâ€™t Do Anything</h1>
<p>From Vitamin Seal</p>
<p><strong>We are the pirates we don't do anything</strong><br />
<strong>We just stay at home and lie around</strong><br />
<strong>And if you ask us to do anything</strong><br />
<strong>We'll just tell you, we don't do anything</strong></p>
<p>Well I've never been to Greenland, and I've never been to Denver<br />
And I've never buried treasure in St. Louie or St. Paul<br />
And I've never been to Moscow, and I've never been to Tampa<br />
And I've never been to Boston in the fall</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>And I've never hoist the main sail, and I've never swabbed the poop deck<br />
And I've never veered starboard 'cause I've never sailed at all<br />
And I've never walked the gang plank, and I've never owned a parrot<br />
And I've never been to Boston in the fall</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>Oh, I've never plucked a rooster and I am not too good at ping-pong<br />
And I've never thrown my mashed potatoes up against the wall<br />
And I've never kissed a chipmunk, and I've never gotten head lice<br />
And I have never been to Boston in the fall<br />
Pirate captains log 2002 who'll be this band Relient K<br />
And why they'll be so full of contradictions<br />
We don't know what he did but we're down with Captain Kidd<br />
We don't wake up before lunch but we all eat Captain Crunch<br />
We don't smoke, we don't chew, we watch Captain Kangaroo<br />
{Ladies and gentlemen let's give them a big hand}</p>
<p><strong>Chorus x 2</strong></p>
