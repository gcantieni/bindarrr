<h1>Black Is The Color Of My True Love’s Hair</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>Black is the color of my true love's hair<br />
Her lips are red like some roses fair<br />
The purest eyes and the gentlest hands<br />
I love the ground whereon she stands</p>
<p>I go to Clyde for to mourn and weep<br />
But satisfied I never can sleep<br />
I'll write to you in a few short lines<br />
I'll suffer death ten thousand times</p>
<p>I love my love and well she knows<br />
I love the grass whereon she goes<br />
If she on earth no more I see<br />
My life will quickly fade away from me</p>
<p><em>Optional:</em><br />
<em>(A winter's past and the leaves are green</em><br />
<em>The time has past that we have seen</em><br />
<em>But still I pray the time will come</em><br />
<em>When she and I will be as one)</em></p>
<p>Black is the color of my true love's hair<br />
Her lips are like some roses fair<br />
The purest eyes and the gentlest hands<br />
I love the ground whereon she stands</p>
<p><em>Optional Ending: </em><br />
<em>Black is the color of my true love’s hair</em><br />
<em>Her lips are like some roses fair </em><br />
<em>The purest hands and the gentlest eyes</em><br />
<em>I love the ground wherein she lies </em></p>
