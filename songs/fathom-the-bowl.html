<h1>Fathom the Bowl</h1>
<p>Come all ye bold heroes, give an ear to me song!<br />
We’ll sing in the praise of good brandy and rum<br />
It’s a clear crystal fountain near Ireland doth roll<br />
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.</p>
<p><strong>I’ll fathom the bowl,</strong><br />
<strong>I’ll fathom the bowl</strong><br />
<strong>Give me the punch ladle;</strong><br />
<strong>I’ll fathom the bowl</strong></p>
<p>From France we do get brandy; from Jamaica comes rum;<br />
Sweet oranges and apples from Portugal come,<br />
But stout and strong cider are Ireland’s control<br />
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.</p>
<p>Me wife she do disturb me when I’m lyin’ at my ease<br />
She does as she likes; she says as she please.<br />
Me wife, she’s the devil, her heart’s hard as coal.<br />
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.</p>
<p>Me father he do lie in the depths of the sea<br />
No stone at his head, but what matters for he<br />
It’s a clear crystal fountain near Ireland doth roll<br />
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.</p>
<p>Come all ye bold heroes, give an ear to me song!<br />
We’ll sing in the praise of good brandy and rum<br />
It’s a clear crystal fountain near Ireland doth roll<br />
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.</p>
