<h1>A Professional Pirate</h1>
<p>When I was just a lad looking for my true vocation<br />
My father said "Now son, this choice deserves deliberation<br />
Though you could be a doctor or perhaps a financier<br />
My boy why not consider a more challenging career"</p>
<p>Hey ho ho<br />
You'll cruise to foreign shores<br />
And you'll keep your mind and body sound<br />
By working out of doors<br />
True friendship and adventure are what we can't live without<br />
And when you're a professional pirate<br />
That's what the job's about</p>
<p>Now take Sir Francis Drake, the Spanish all despise him<br />
But to the British he's a hero and they idolize him<br />
It's how you look at buccaneers that makes them bad or good<br />
And I see us as members of a noble brotherhood</p>
<p>Hey ho ho<br />
We're honorable men<br />
And before we lose our tempers we will always count to ten<br />
On occasion there may be someone you have to execute<br />
But when you’re a professional pirate<br />
You don't have to wear a suit.....what?</p>
<p>I could have been a surgeon<br />
I like taking things apart</p>
<p>I could have been a lawyer<br />
But I just had too much heart</p>
<p>I could have been in politics<br />
Cause I've always been a big spender</p>
<p>And me...I could have been a contender</p>
<p>Some say that pirates steal and should be feared and hated<br />
I say we're victims of bad press it's all exaggerated<br />
We'd never stab you in the back, we'd never lie or cheat<br />
We're just about the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet</p>
<p>Hey ho ho<br />
It's one for all for one<br />
And we'll share and share alike with you and love you like a son<br />
We're gentlemen of fortune and that's what we're proud to be<br />
And when you’re a professional pirate<br />
You'll be honest brave and free<br />
The soul of decency<br />
You'll be loyal and fair and on the square<br />
And most importantly<br />
When you're a professional pirate<br />
You're always in the best of company</p>
