<h1>Down Among The Dead Men</h1>
<p>(from Captain Whatsit the Dreadful)</p>
<p>Here’s a health to the Queen and a lasting peace:<br />
To faction an end; to wealth increase!<br />
Come let us drink while we have breath<br />
For there’s no drinking after death.</p>
<p><strong>And he that will this health deny</strong><br />
<strong>Down among the dead men, down among the dead men</strong><br />
<strong>Down, down, down, down</strong><br />
<strong>Down among the dead men let him lie!</strong></p>
<p>In smiling Bacchus’ joys I’ll roll;<br />
Deny no pleasure to my soul<br />
Let Bacchus’ health ‘round quickly move<br />
For Bacchus is a friend to love.</p>
<p>Let love and wine their rights maintain<br />
And their united pleasures reign<br />
While Bacchus’ treasures crown the board,<br />
We’ll drink the joys that both afford!</p>
<p>Here’s a health to the things that we hold dear:<br />
To those who would these us deny:<br />
May ye sadly live and sober die!</p>
