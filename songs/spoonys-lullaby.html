<h1>Spoony’s Lullaby</h1>
<p>from Spoony the Sooner Fed (sanctioned by The Hearty Rumaway)</p>
<p>Spoony Spoony Spoony Spoony Spoony Spoony<br />
Spoony Spoony Spoony Spoon<br />
Spoony Spoony Spoony Spoony Spoony Spoony<br />
Spoony Spoony Spoony Spoon</p>
<p><strong>Spoony the Sooner Fed</strong><br />
<strong>Ynoops eht Renoos Def</strong><br />
<strong>Rummy</strong> (NOTE: pronounced rum-AY as in AYYYYYYYYY lmao)</p>
<p>Attend the tale of Spoony Todd<br />
His skin was pale and his eye was odd<br />
He took the spoons of gentlemen<br />
Who never thereafter were heard of again<br />
He trod a path that few have trod, did Spoony Todd<br />
The demon spoon of Spoon Street<br />
Swing your ladle high, Spoony! Hold it to the sky!<br />
Freely flows the soup of those who moralize</p>
<p>And here’s to you, Hearty Rumaway<br />
Grandma (NOTE: Magpie) loves you more than you will know (oh oh oh)<br />
Treezus bless you please, Hearty Rumaway<br />
Fiddler’s Green holds a place for those who play rug-bay (be careful)</p>
<p>Spoony! Goin’ in on a verse and I never been defeated and I won’t stop now<br />
Keep your hands up put ‘em in the sky for the pirates didn’t make it and my fish locked down<br />
Make millions every year, the West's champion<br />
'Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I, all I do is…<br />
WIN WIN WIN NO MATTER WHAT</p>
<p>A spoonful of rum helps the medicine go down<br />
The medicine go down, the medicine go down<br />
A spoonful of rum helps the medicine go down<br />
In the most piratical way</p>
