<h1>Tobacco Island</h1>
<p><strong>Off to hell we must sail for the shores of sweet Barbados</strong><br />
<strong>Where the sugar cane grows taller than the God we once believed in</strong><br />
<strong>Till the butcher and his crown raped the land we used to sleep in</strong><br />
<strong>Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes that haunt Tobacco Island</strong></p>
<p>'Twas 1659 forgotten now for sure<br />
They dragged us from our homeland with the musket and their gun<br />
Cromwell and his roundheads battered all we know<br />
Shackled hopes of freedom<br />
We're now but stolen goods<br />
Dark is the horizon, blackened by the sun<br />
This rotten cage of Bridgetown is where I now belong</p>
<p>Red leg down a peg<br />
Blistered burns the soul<br />
The floggings they're a plenty, but reasons there are none<br />
Our backs belong to landlords where branded is their name<br />
Paid for with ten shillings<br />
Cheap labor never breaks<br />
The silver moon is shinin'<br />
Cools the copper blood<br />
Where the livin' meet the dead and together dance as one</p>
<p>Agony, will you cleanse this misery?<br />
For it's never again I'll breathe the air of home<br />
From this sandy edge the rolling sea breaks my revenge<br />
With each whisper a thousand waves I hear roar<br />
I'm coming home<br />
Dark is the horizon blackened by the sun<br />
This rotten cage of Bridgetown is where I now belong</p>
