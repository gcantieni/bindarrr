<h1>Pirate Chantey</h1>
<p><em><strong>Key and Peele</strong></em></p>
<p>| I once met a lass so fine She was drunk on barley wine I’d been to sea for months a’three I knew I could make her mine And the lass was past consent So it’s off with her we went And we threw her in bed and rested her head And we left because that’s what gentlemen do A woman has a right to a drink or two  Without worrying about what you will do We say yo ho but we don’t say ho ‘Cause ho is disrespectful, yo There once was a gal from Leeds Who I’d heard was good on her knees So I docked my ship for an overnight trip  to take care of all my needs She was fine as the tales did tell And my mast began to swell So I laid her down and raised her gown And performed cunnilingus for an hour or so Always take care of your lady fair ‘Cause they deserve as much attention down there We say yo ho… I once had a woman so fair Whose womb contained my heir With a son by my side, the seas we’d ride The child she would bear But my girl she was no fool She was working her way through school So I did support when she chose to abort,  because it’s her body and therefore her choice | No we don’t say booty ‘less we’re talkin ‘bout gold We don’t look at chests ‘less they treasure hold With a hat and a feather and a cutlass on our hip We don’t ever say she when we’re talking ‘bout a ship We don’t say bitch and we don’t say whore ‘Cause that language leads to things like body dysmorphia  There was a lady with a golden eye And the doctor said she would die So she emptied her purse to lift the curse And prayed to stay alive She awoke the very next day And in her grave she lay But the scariest part of the story from the start Is I bet you assumed the doctor was a man Women are doctors, too And for a fraction of the doubloons We say yo ho… There was a slut with tits to here And an ass that – [SINGER IS <em>ABRUPTLY</em> CUT OFF] ‘Cause it’s yo ho but we don’t say ho ‘Cause ho is disrespectful, yo |
