<h1>Pirate Chantey</h1>
<p>Key and Peele<br />

<td>I once met a lass so fine<br />
She was drunk on barley wine<br />
I’d been to sea for months a’three<br />
I knew I could make her mine<br />
And the lass was past consent<br />
So it’s off with her we went<br />
And we threw her in bed and rested her head<br />
And we left because that’s what gentlemen do</p>
<p>A woman has a right to a drink or two<br />
Without worrying about what you will do<br />
We say yo ho but we don’t say ho<br />
‘Cause ho is disrespectful, yo</p>
<p>There once was a gal from Leeds<br />
Who I’d heard was good on her knees<br />
So I docked my ship for an overnight trip<br />
to take care of all my needs<br />
She was fine as the tales did tell<br />
And my mast began to swell<br />
So I laid her down and raised her gown<br />
And performed cunnilingus for an hour or so</p>
<p>Always take care of your lady fair<br />
‘Cause they deserve as much attention down there<br />
We say yo ho…</p>
<p>I once had a woman so fair<br />
Whose womb contained my heir<br />
With a son by my side, the seas we’d ride<br />
The child she would bear<br />
But my girl she was no fool<br />
She was working her way through school<br />
So I did support when she chose to abort,<br />
because it’s her body and therefore her choice</td><br />
<td>No we don’t say booty ‘less we’re talkin ‘bout gold<br />
We don’t look at chests ‘less they treasure hold<br />
With a hat and a feather and a cutlass on our hip<br />
We don’t ever say she when we’re talking ‘bout a ship<br />
We don’t say bitch and we don’t say whore<br />
‘Cause that language leads to things like body dysmorphia</p>
<p>There was a lady with a golden eye<br />
And the doctor said she would die<br />
So she emptied her purse to lift the curse<br />
And prayed to stay alive<br />
She awoke the very next day<br />
And in her grave she lay<br />
But the scariest part of the story from the start<br />
Is I bet you assumed the doctor was a man</p>
<p>Women are doctors, too<br />
And for a fraction of the doubloons<br />
We say yo ho…</p>
<p>There was a slut with tits to here<br />
And an ass that –</p>
<p>‘Cause it’s yo ho but we don’t say ho<br />
‘Cause ho is disrespectful, yo</td><br />
