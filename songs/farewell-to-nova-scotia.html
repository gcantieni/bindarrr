<h1>Farewell To Nova Scotia</h1>
<p>The sun was setting in the West<br />
The birds were singing on every tree<br />
All nature seemed inclined to rest<br />
But still there was no rest for me</p>
<p><strong>So farewell to Nova Scotia, your sea-bound coast</strong><br />
<strong>Let your mountains dark and drear-y be</strong><br />
<strong>For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed</strong><br />
<strong>Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?</strong></p>
<p>I grieve to leave my native land<br />
I grieve to leave my comrades all<br />
And my parents whom I held so dear<br />
And the bonny bonny lassie that I do adore</p>
<p>Well the drums do beat and the wars do alarm<br />
My captain calls, I must obey<br />
So farewell, farewell to Nova Scotia’s charms<br />
For it’s early in the morning I'll be far far away</p>
<p>I have three brothers, they are at rest<br />
Their arms are folded on their breast<br />
But a poor simple sailor just like me<br />
Must be tossed and driven on the dark blue sea</p>
<p><em>Won’t you keep a watch on Nova Scotia’s shores for me</em></p>
