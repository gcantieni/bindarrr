<h1>Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>While on the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo (x2)<br />
While on the road to sweet Athy, a stick in me hand and a drop in me eye<br />
A doleful damsel I heard cry:<br />
"Johnny I hardly knew ye"</p>
<p><strong>With guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo (x2)</strong><br />
<strong>With guns and drums and drums and guns, the enemy nearly slew ye</strong><br />
<strong>My darlin dear ye look so queer</strong><br />
<strong>Johnny I hardly knew ye</strong></p>
<p>Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo, hurroo (x2)<br />
Where are the eyes that looked so mild when my heart ye first beguiled<br />
Why did ye skedaddle from me and the child<br />
Johnny I hardly knew ye</p>
<p>Where are the legs with which ye run, hurroo, hurroo (x2)<br />
Where are the legs with which ye run when first ye went to carry a gun<br />
Indeed yer dancing days are done<br />
Johnny I hardly knew ye</p>
<p>Ye haven’t an arm, ye haven’t a leg, hurroo, hurroo (x2)<br />
Ye haven’t an arm, ye haven’t a leg, ye’re an eyeless, boneless chickenless egg<br />
Ye’ll have to be put with a bowl to beg<br />
Johnny I hardly knew ye</p>
<p>I’m happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo (x2)<br />
I’m happy for to see ye home, all from the island of Ceylon<br />
So low in flesh, so high in bone<br />
Johnny I hardly knew ye</p>
<p>They’re rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo (x2)<br />
They’re rolling out the guns again, but they’ll never take our sons again<br />
No they’ll never take our sons again<br />
Johnny I’m swearin’ to ye</p>
