<h1>The Rising of the Moon</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Corvis the Nightterror</strong></em></p>
<p>And come tell me Sean O'Farrell, tell me why you hurry so<br />
Hush mbhuachaill[^27], hush and listen and his cheeks were all aglow<br />
I bear orders from the captain, get you ready quick and soon<br />
<strong>For the pikes must be together at the rising of the moon</strong></p>
<p><strong>At the rising of the moon, at the rising of the moon</strong><br />
<strong>For the pikes must be together at the rising of the moon</strong></p>
<p>And come tell me Sean O'Farrell, where the gathering is to be<br />
At the old spot by the river quite well known to you and me<br />
One more word for signal token, whistle out the marching tune<br />
<strong>With your pike upon your shoulder at the rising of the moon</strong></p>
<p>Out from many a mud walled cabin eyes were watching through the night<br />
Many a manly heart was beating for the blessed morning's light<br />
Murmurs ran along the valley to the banshee's lonely croon<br />
<strong>And a thousand pikes were flashing by the rising of the moon</strong></p>
<p>All along that singing river, that black mass of men was seen<br />
High above their shining weapons flew their own beloved green<br />
Death to every foe and traitor, whistle out the marching tune</p>
<p><strong>And hoorah me boys for freedom 'tis the rising of the moon</strong></p>
