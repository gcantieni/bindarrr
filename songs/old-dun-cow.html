<h1>Old Dun Cow</h1>
<p>Some friends and I in a public house were playin’ dominoes one night<br />
When into the room a fireman came, his face all chalky white<br />
"What’s up," says Brown, “Have you seen a ghost? Have you seen your Aunt Mariah?”<br />
"Oh me Aunt Mariah be buggered," said he, “The bleedin’ pub’s on fire!”</p>
<p>"Oh" says Brown, “what a bit o’ luck, everybody follow me<br />
It’s down to the cellar, if the fire’s not there, we’ll have a grand old spree!"<br />
So we all went down with good old Brown, and the booze we could not miss,<br />
And we hadn’t been there ten minutes or more ‘til we were quite like this: oh</p>
<p><strong>There was Brown, upside down, moppin’ up the whiskey on the floor,</strong><br />
<strong>"Booze! Booze!" the firemen cried, as they came a-knockin’ at the door;</strong><br />
<strong>Oh don’t let ‘em in ‘til it’s all drunk up, somebody shouted "MacIntyre!" (MacIntyre!!!)</strong><br />
<strong>And we all got blue blind paralytic drunk when the Old Dun Cow caught fire</strong>.</p>
<p>Then Smith went over to the port wine tub and gave it just two hard knocks,<br />
Started takin’ off his pantaloons, likewise his shoes and socks;<br />
"Hold on," says Brown, “That ain’t allowed, you can’t do that in here!<br />
Don’t be washing your trousers in the port wine tub when we’ve got [Genesee] beer!"</p>
<p>Oh, then there came a mighty crash, half the bloody roof caved in,<br />
We were drownin’ in the fireman’s hose, though we were almost happy,<br />
So we got some tacks and some old wet sacks, and we tacked ourselves inside,<br />
And we sat there getting bleary-eyed drunk when the Old Dun Cow caught fire.</p>
