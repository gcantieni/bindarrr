<h1>Molasses</h1>
<p>Tom Rowe</p>
<p>Oh, the African man cuts the sugar cane<br />
<strong>Oh, molasses </strong><br />
He works in the sun and he works in the rain<br />
<strong>Oh, molasses rum </strong><br />
Then he loads it up on a wooden ship and he sends it off on a northern trip<br />
<strong>Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum </strong></p>
<p><strong>Oh, molasses </strong><br />
<strong>Old New England tea </strong><br />
<strong>It killed my grandpa, killed my pa </strong><br />
<strong>And it sure as Hell is killing me </strong><br />
<strong>Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum </strong></p>
<p>When they fought the war for the colonies…<br />
They fought it over New England tea…<br />
When Old King George put a tax on it the colonies nearly took a fit…</p>
<p>In the time of the 1917 war<br />
Molasses sitting on the Boston shore<br />
When they pumped it in it was twelve degrees, a long cold night in a Boston freeze<br />
In the morning it was 42<br />
Molasses vat split clean in two<br />
Two million gallons covered the bay, 26 people drowned in the flood that day</p>
<p>My grandpa he died cutting cane<br />
My pa went down in the great brown rain<br />
But I won’t go in a pool of blood; no I won’t drown in a black-strap flood<br />
Still, I’ll go down to molasses, oh molasses rum</p>
