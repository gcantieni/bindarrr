<h1>The Final Trawl</h1>
<p>Archie Fisher</p>
<p>Now it's three long years since we made her pay<br />
<strong>Haul away, me laddie-o</strong><br />
And the owners say that she's had her day<br />
<strong>Sing haul away, me laddie-o</strong></p>
<p>So it's heave away for the final trawl<br />
It's an easy pull, for the catch is small</p>
<p>Now itâ€™s stow your gear, lads, and batten down<br />
And I'll take the wheel, lads, and turn her round</p>
<p>And we'll join "The Venture" and "The Morning Star"<br />
Riding high and empty towards the bar<br />
For I'd rather beach her on the skerry rock<br />
Than to see her torched in the breakers Docklands</p>
<p>And when I die, you can stow me down<br />
In her rusty hold, where the breakers sound</p>
<p>Then I'll make the haven of Fiddler's Green<br />
Where the grub is good and the bunks are clean</p>
<p>For I've fished a lifetime, boy and man<br />
And the final trawl scarcely nets a cran</p>
<p>So it's heave away for the final trawl<br />
It's an easy pull, for the catch is small</p>
