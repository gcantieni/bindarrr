<h1>Wave Over Wave</h1>
<p>Oh me name's Able Rodgers, a share man am I<br />
On a three masted schooner from Twillingate Isle<br />
I've been the world over north, south, east, and west<br />
But the middle of nowhere wheres' I likes it best</p>
<p><strong>Where its wave over wave, sea over bow<br />
I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow<br />
There’s no other life for a sailor like me<br />
And to sail the salt sea boys, sail the sea<br />
There's no other life but to sail the salt sea</strong></p>
<p>Well I leave my wife lonely ten months of the year<br />
For she built me a home and raised my children there<br />
She never come out to bid farewell to me<br />
Or ken why a sailor must sail the salt sea</p>
<p>The work it is hard and the hours are long<br />
But my spirit is willing, my back it is strong<br />
And when the works over the whiskey will pour<br />
We'll dance with the girls upon some foreign shore</p>
<p>I've sailed the world over for decades or more<br />
And oft times I wonder what I do it for<br />
I don’t know the answer it’s pleasure and pain<br />
But with life to live over I'd do it again</p>
