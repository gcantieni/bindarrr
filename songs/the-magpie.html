<h1>The Magpie</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Barefoot the Bootless</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>One's for sorrow, two's for joy</strong><br />
<strong>Three's for a girl and four's for a boy</strong><br />
<strong>Five's for silver, six for gold</strong><br />
<strong>Seven's for a secret never told</strong><br />
<strong>Devil, devil, I defy thee (x3)</strong></p>
<p>Oh, the magpie brings us tidings<br />
Of news both fair and foul<br />
She's more cunning than the raven<br />
More wise than any owl<br />
For she brings us news of the harvest<br />
Of the barley, wheat, and corn<br />
And she knows when we'll go to our graves<br />
And how we shall be born</p>
<p>She brings us joy when from the right<br />
Grief when from the left<br />
Of all the news that's in the air<br />
We know to trust her best<br />
For she sees us at our labour<br />
And she mocks us at our work<br />
And she steals the eggs from out of the nest<br />
And she can mob the hawk</p>
<p>The priest, he says we're wicked<br />
For to worship the devil's bird<br />
Ah, but we respect the old ways<br />
And we disregard his word<br />
For we know they rest uneasy<br />
As we slumber in the night<br />
And we'll always leave out a little bit of meat<br />
For the bird that's black and white</p>
