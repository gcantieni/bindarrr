<h1>Chicken On A Raft</h1>
<p>Skipper’s in the wardroom drinking gin<br />
<strong>Hi ho, chicken on a raft</strong><br />
I don’t mind knocking, but I ain’t going in!<br />
<strong>Hi ho, chicken on a raft</strong><br />
The Jimmy’s laughing like a drain,<br />
<strong>Hi ho, chicken on a raft</strong><br />
He’s looking at me "comic cuts" again!<br />
<strong>Hi ho, chicken on a raft</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chicken on a raft on a Monday morning</strong><br />
<strong>Oh, what a terrible sight to see</strong><br />
<strong>’Dabtoe’s for’ard and the dustman’s aft</strong><br />
<strong>Sittin’ there pickin’ at a chicken on a raft</strong><br />
<strong>Hi ho, chicken on a raft </strong><br />
<strong>Hi ho, chicken on a raft </strong></p>
<p>Gave me the middle and the forenoon too<br />
And now I’m pulling in the whaler’s crew<br />
Seagulls wheeling overhead<br />
I oughter be home in me featherbed</p>
<p>I had a little girl in Donny-Bee<br />
And did she make a fool of me<br />
Her heart was like a pusser’s shower,<br />
Run hot to cold in a quarter of an hour</p>
<p>I had a little girl lived in Dumfries<br />
Only had her kids in twos and threes<br />
Her sister lives in Maryhill<br />
Says she won’t, (And I respect her free will!) (And I respect her decision!) (And I think she won’t!)</p>
