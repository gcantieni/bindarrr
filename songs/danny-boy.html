<h1>Danny Boy</h1>
<p><em><strong>Formerly in the Irish Packet</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling<br />
From glen to glen, and down the mountainside.<br />
The summer's gone, and all the leaves are falling.<br />
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.<br />
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow<br />
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,<br />
For I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow.<br />
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so.</p>
<p>But if you come, and all the flowers are dying<br />
And if I'm dead, as dead I well may be.<br />
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying<br />
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.<br />
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,<br />
And o'er my grave shall warmer, sweeter be,<br />
And if you bend and tell me that you love me,<br />
Then I shall sleep in peace until you come to me.</p>
