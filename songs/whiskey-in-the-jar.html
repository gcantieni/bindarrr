<h1>Whiskey In The Jar</h1>
<p>As I was going over the far-famed Kerry Mountains<br />
I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was counting<br />
I first produced my pistol, and then produced my rapier<br />
Saying "stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver"</p>
<p><strong>Musha ring dum a do dum a da</strong><br />
<strong>Whack fol the daddy-o, whack fol the daddy-o</strong><br />
<strong>There’s whiskey in the jar</strong></p>
<p>I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny<br />
I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny<br />
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me<br />
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy</p>
<p>I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber<br />
I dreamt of gold and jewels, and sure it was no wonder<br />
That Jenny took my changes and she filled them up with water<br />
And sent for Captain Farrell to make ready for the slaughter</p>
<p>T’was early in the morning, afore I rose to travel<br />
Up comes a band of footmen, and likewise Captain Farrell<br />
I first produced my pistol for she’d stolen away my rapier<br />
But I couldn’t shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken</p>
<p>Well they threw me in the jail, said the years I would be counting<br />
For robbing Captain Farrell in the far-famed Kerry Mountains<br />
But they didn’t take me fists so I knocked the jailer down<br />
And I bid a fond farewell to that jail in Liverpool town</p>
<p>If anyone can aid me it’s my brother in the army<br />
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney<br />
And if he’ll go with me we’ll go roving in Kilkenny<br />
I’m sure he’ll treat me better than my own disporting Jenny</p>
<p>There’s some take delight in the hurling and the bowling<br />
And some take delight in the carriages a-rolling<br />
But I take delight in the juice of the barley<br />
And courting pretty, fair maids in the morning bright and early</p>
