<h1>The Mariner's Revenge Song</h1>
<table>  
<tr>  
<td>We are two mariners  
Our ship's sole survivors   
In this belly of a whale.   
Its ribs are ceiling beams   
Its guts are carpeting  
I guess we have some time to kill.    
  
You may not remember me   
I was a child of three   
And you, a lad of eighteen.   
But I remember you   
And I will relate to you   
How our histories interweave:  
  
At the time you were  arake and a roustabout   
Spending all your money  on the whores and hounds (oh, oh)  
  
You had a charming air   
All cheap and debonair   
My widowed mother found so sweet,   
And so she took you in   
Her sheets still warm with him   
Now filled with filth and foul disease.   
  
As time wore on you proved  a debt-ridden drunken mess   
Leaving my mother  a poor consumptive wretch  (oh, oh)  
  
And then you disappeared   
Your gambling arrears   
The only thing you left behind.   
And then the magistrate   
Reclaimed our small estate  
And my poor mother lost her mind.   
  
Then, one day in spring  my dear sweet mother died   
But, before she did  I took her hand as she, dying, cried:  (oh, oh)  
  
"Find him, Bind him   
Tie him to a pole and break   
His fingers to splinters   
Drag him to a hole until he  
Wakes up naked   
Clawing at the ceiling  
Of his grave!"</td>  
<td>It took me fifteen years  
To swallow all my tears   
Among the urchins in the street   
Until a priory   
Took pity and hired me   
To keep their vestry nice and neat.   
  
But, never once in the employ  of these holy men   
Did I ever, once turn my mind from the thought of revenge (oh, oh)  
  
One night I overheard   
The prior exchanging words   
With a penitent whaler from the sea:   
The captain of his ship   
Who matched you toe to tip  
Was known for wanton cruelty.   
  
The following day  I shipped to sea  with a privateer   
And in the whistle  of the wind  I could almost hear (oh, oh)  
  
Chorus  
  
"There is one thing I must say to you   
As you sail across the sea   
Always, your mother will watch over you   
As you avenge this wicked deed"   
  
And then, that fateful night   
We had you in our sight   
After twenty months at sea   
Your starboard flank abeam   
I was getting my muskets clean   
When came this rumbling from beneath   
  
The ocean shook , the sky went black  and the captain quailed   
And before us grew  the angry jaws  of a giant whale   (oh..)   
  
I don't know how I survived   
The crew all was chewed alive   
I must have slipped between his teeth   
But, oh, what providence   
What divine intelligence   
That you should survive   
As well as me  
  
 It gives my heart great joy  to see your eyes fill with fear  
So lean in close  and I will whisper he last words you'll hear  (oh, oh)</td>
