<h1>Marching Inland</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Chase the Wild Goose</strong></em></p>
<p>Lord Nelson knew the perfect way to cure your <em>mal de mer</em><br />
And if you pay attention, his secret I will share<br />
To any sea-sick sailor he'd give this advice for free:<br />
"If you're feeling sea-sick, sit underneath a tree!"</p>
<p><strong>I'm marching inland from the shore</strong><br />
<strong>Over me shoulder I'm carryin' an oar</strong><br />
<strong>When someone asks me: "What is that funny thing you got?"</strong><br />
<strong>Then I know I'll never go to sea no more, no more</strong><br />
<strong>Then I know I'll never go to sea no more!</strong></p>
<p>Drake he's in his hammock and a thousand miles away<br />
Grenville's Revenge is at the bottom of the bay<br />
Many's a famous sailor never came home from sea<br />
So take my advice, Jack, come and follow me</p>
<p>Sailors take a lesson from this crew of high renown<br />
When you leave the ocean and it's time to settle down<br />
Never cast your anchor less than ninety miles from shore<br />
There'd always be temptation to be off to sea once more</p>
