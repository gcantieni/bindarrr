<h1>Hoist The Colours</h1>
<p>The king and his men stole the queen from her bed<br />
And bound her in her bones<br />
The seas be ours and by the powers<br />
Where we will we'll roam</p>
<p><strong>Yo, ho, all hands</strong><br />
<strong>Hoist the colours high</strong><br />
<strong>Heave ho, thieves and beggars</strong><br />
<strong>Never shall we die</strong></p>
<p>Some men have died and some are alive<br />
And others sail on the sea<br />
With the keys to the cage and the Devil to pay<br />
We lay to Fiddler's Green</p>
<p><strong>Yo, ho, haul together…</strong></p>
<p>The bell has been raised from its watery grave<br />
Do you hear its sepulchral tone?<br />
We’re a call to all, pay heed the squall<br />
And turn your sails toward home!</p>
