<h1>The Mariner's Revenge Song</h1>
<p><em><strong>The Decemberists</strong></em></p>
<p>We are two mariners<br />
Our ship's sole survivors<br />
In this belly of a whale.<br />
Its ribs are ceiling beams<br />
Its guts are carpeting<br />
I guess we have some time to kill.</p>
<p>You may not remember me<br />
I was a child of three<br />
And you, a lad of eighteen.<br />
But I remember you<br />
And I will relate to you<br />
How our histories interweave:</p>
<p>At the time you were arake and a roustabout<br />
Spending all your money on the whores[^13] and hounds (oh, oh)</p>
<p>You had a charming air<br />
All cheap and debonair<br />
My widowed mother found so sweet,<br />
And so she took you in<br />
Her sheets still warm with him<br />
Now filled with filth and foul disease.</p>
<p>As time wore on you proved a debt-ridden drunken mess<br />
Leaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch (oh, oh)</p>
<p>And then you disappeared<br />
Your gambling arrears<br />
The only thing you left behind.<br />
And then the magistrate<br />
Reclaimed our small estate<br />
And my poor mother lost her mind.</p>
<p>Then, one day in spring my dear sweet mother died<br />
But, before she did I took her hand as she, dying, cried: (oh, oh)</p>
<p><strong>"Find him, Bind him</strong><br />
<strong>Tie him to a pole and break</strong><br />
<strong>His fingers to splinters</strong><br />
<strong>Drag him to a hole until he</strong><br />
<strong>Wakes up naked</strong><br />
<strong>Clawing at the ceiling</strong><br />
<strong>Of his grave!”</strong></p>
<p>it took me fifteen years<br />
To swallow all my tears<br />
Among the urchins in the street<br />
Until a priory<br />
Took pity and hired me<br />
To keep their vestry nice and neat.</p>
<p>But, never once in the employ of these holy men<br />
Did I ever, once turn my mind from the thought of revenge (oh, oh)</p>
<p>One night I overheard<br />
The prior exchanging words<br />
With a penitent whaler from the sea:<br />
The captain of his ship<br />
Who matched you toe to tip<br />
Was known for wanton cruelty.</p>
<p>The following day I shipped to sea with a privateer<br />
And in the whistle of the wind I could almost hear (oh, oh)</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>“There is one thing I must say to you<br />
As you sail across the sea<br />
Always, your mother will watch over you<br />
As you avenge this wicked deed"</p>
<p>And then, that fateful night<br />
We had you in our sight<br />
After twenty months at sea<br />
Your starboard flank abeam<br />
I was getting my muskets clean<br />
When came this rumbling from beneath</p>
<p>The ocean shook, the sky went black and the captain quailed<br />
And before us grew the angry jaws of a giant whale (oh..)</p>
<p>I don't know how I survived<br />
The crew all was chewed alive<br />
I must have slipped between his teeth<br />
But, oh, what providence<br />
What divine intelligence<br />
That you should survive<br />
As well as me</p>
<p>It gives my heart great joy to see your eyes fill with fear<br />
So lean in close and I will whisper the last words you'll hear  (oh, oh)</p>
