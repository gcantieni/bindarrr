<h1>The Minstrel Boy</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>The minstrel boy to war is gone<br />
In the ranks of death you will find him<br />
His father’s sword he hath girded on<br />
And his wild harp slung behind him<br />
"Land of Song!" cried the warrior bard<br />
"Tho’ every man betray thee<br />
One sword, at least, thy ranks shall guard<br />
One faithful harp shall praise thee!"</p>
<p>The Minstrel fell, but the foeman’s steel<br />
Could not bring that proud soul under<br />
The harp he loved ne’er spoke again<br />
For he tore its chords asunder<br />
And said, "No chains shall sully thee<br />
Thou soul of love and bravery!<br />
Thy songs were made for the pure and free<br />
They shall never sound in slavery!"</p>
