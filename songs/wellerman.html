<h1>Wellerman</h1>
<p>The Longest Johns</p>
<p><strong>Soon may the Wellerman come</strong><br />
<strong>To bring us sugar and tea and rum</strong><br />
<strong>One day, when the tonguin' is done</strong><br />
<strong>We'll take our leave and go</strong></p>
<p>There once was a ship that put to sea<br />
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea<br />
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down<br />
O blow, my bully boys, blow</p>
<p>She had not been two weeks from shore<br />
When down on her a right whale bore<br />
The captain called all hands and swore<br />
He'd take that whale in tow</p>
<p>Before the boat had hit the water<br />
The whale's tail came up and caught her<br />
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her<br />
When she dived down below</p>
<p>No line was cut, no whale was freed;<br />
The Captain's mind was not of greed<br />
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;<br />
She took the ship in tow</p>
<p>For forty days, or even more<br />
The line went slack, then tight once more<br />
All boats were lost (there were only four)<br />
But still that whale did go</p>
<p>As far as I've heard, the fight's still on;<br />
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone<br />
The Wellerman makes his regular call<br />
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all</p>
