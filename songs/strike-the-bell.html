<h1>Strike the Bell</h1>
<p><em><strong>From Willy-Nilly the Filibuster</strong></em></p>
<p>Up on the poop deck and walking about,<br />
There is the second mate so steady and so stout.<br />
What he is a-thinkin’ of he doesn’t want to tell,<br />
We wish that he would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.</p>
<p><strong>Strike the bell second mate, let us go below;</strong><br />
<strong>Look ye well to windward you can see it’s going to blow.</strong><br />
<strong>Look at the glass you can see that it has fell,</strong><br />
<strong>We wish that you would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.</strong></p>
<p>Down on the main deck and workin’ at the pumps,<br />
There is the larboard watch just longing for their bunks;<br />
Look out to windward, you can see a great swell,<br />
We wish that he would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.</p>
<p>Forward on the forecastle head and keepin’ sharp lookout,<br />
There is Johnny standin’, a longin’ fer to shout,<br />
“Lights are burnin’ bright sir and everything is well.”<br />
He’s wishing that the second mate would, strike the bell.</p>
<p>Aft on the wheelhouse old Anderson stands,<br />
Graspin’ at the helm with his frostbitten hands,<br />
Lookin’ at the compass though the course is clear as hell;<br />
He’s wishin’ that the second mate would, strike the bell.</p>
<p>Aft on the quarter deck our gallant captain stands,<br />
Lookin’ out to windward with a spyglass in his hand.<br />
What he is a-thinkin’ of we know very well.<br />
He’s thinking more of shortenin’ sail than striking the bell.</p>
