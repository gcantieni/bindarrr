<h1>Bound for Amerikay</h1>
<p>Paul Lauzon, from Albatrossity</p>
<p>Come all ye and listen to a tale that is true<br />
The Liverpool paper said, "Men we need you<br />
Young men and strong come sign up today<br />
In the morning we’re bound for Amerikay"</p>
<p>So I says to the captain Mr. Plato Denney,<br />
"Sir, I crave to be free of this poverty"<br />
He said, "Sign here young man, come give us a hand<br />
In seven short years you will own your own land"</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br />
<strong>Hey boys, won’t you sing us a song</strong><br />
<strong>Hey boys, to last the whole night long</strong><br />
<strong>Ah love, don’t you turn me away</strong><br />
<strong>In the morning I’m bound for Amerikay</strong></p>
<p>We set sail from Liverpool across the wide sea<br />
In April of seventeen hundred and seventy<br />
Thirty-eight men, no children, no wives<br />
Bound for the new world to make new lives</p>
<p>Hail, sleet and rain, a confused angry sea<br />
With close smelling quarters – you had to fight just to breathe<br />
Weary and wasted sailors we were<br />
Eating salt beef and biscuits with water and vinegar</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>In summer we landed on Campobell’ Isle<br />
And they put us to work in a very short while<br />
Building houses and barns, planting turnips and grain<br />
And fishing for cod in the wind and the rain</p>
<p>Oh, the masters were hard as my calluses showed<br />
It was us made them rich but still debts we owed<br />
We’d work from the dust to the late setting sun<br />
But at night we’d forget with our spruce beer and rum</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>In seventeen hundred and seventy two<br />
We ambushed the captain and told him we were through<br />
Of slaving for nothing in a land not our own<br />
And at gunpoint we told him you’re taking us back home</p>
<p>We set sail for Liverpool, ‘twas late in the year<br />
Each role of the ship, we let out a cheer<br />
Free men at last, ourselves in command<br />
But our good ship went down just after Newfoundland</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
