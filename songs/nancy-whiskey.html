<h1>Nancy Whiskey</h1>
<p><strong>Whiskey whiskey, Nancy Whiskey</strong><br />
<strong>Whiskey whiskey, Nancy-O!</strong><br />
<strong>Whiskey whiskey, Nancy Whiskey</strong><br />
<strong>Whiskey whiskey, Nancy-O!</strong></p>
<p>I am a weaver, a Carlton weaver,<br />
I am a brash and a roving blade,<br />
I got silver in my britches,<br />
And I follow the roving trade</p>
<p>I went into Glasgow city,<br />
Nancy Whiskey I did smell,<br />
I walked in, sat down beside her,<br />
Seven long years; I loved her well</p>
<p>The more I kissed her, the more I knew her,<br />
The more I loved her, the more she smiled,<br />
I forgot my mother's teaching,<br />
Nancy soon had me beguiled!</p>
<p>Woke up early in the morning,<br />
Lying halfway off the bed,<br />
Tried to rise, but I was not able,<br />
Nancy damn near knocked me dead!</p>
<p>I'll get back to the Carlton weaving,<br />
Surely make those shuttles fly,<br />
I'll make more at the Carlton weaving,<br />
Than ever I did at the roving way</p>
<p>All you weavers, you Carlton weavers,<br />
All you weavers where e'er you be,<br />
Beware of whiskey, Nancy Whiskey,<br />
She'll ruin you as she ruined me!</p>
