<h1>The Chemical Workersâ€™ Song (Process Man)</h1>
<hr />
<p><em><strong>From Easterly Westerly</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>And it's go boys go</strong><br />
<strong>They'll time your every breath</strong><br />
<strong>And every day you're in this place</strong><br />
<strong>You're two days nearer death</strong><br />
<strong>But you go...</strong></p>
<p>Well a Process Man am I and I'm tellin' you no lie<br />
I work and breathe among the fumes that trail across the sky<br />
There's thunder all around me and there's poison in the air<br />
There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair</p>
<p>Well, I've worked among the spinners and I breathe the oily smoke<br />
I've shoveled up the gypsum and it nigh on makes you choke<br />
I've stood knee deep in cyanide, got sick with a caustic burn<br />
Been working rough, I've seen enough to make your stomach turn</p>
<p>There's overtime and bonus opportunities galore<br />
The young men like their money and they all come back for more<br />
But soon you're knocking on and you look older than you should<br />
For every bob made on the job, you pay with flesh and blood</p>
<p>Well a Process Man am I, and I'm telling you no lie<br />
I work and breathe among the fumes that trail across the sky<br />
There's thunder all around me and there's poison in the air<br />
There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair</p>
