<h1>Maggie May</h1>
<p>Come all ye sailors bold, and when me tale is told<br />
I know ye all will sadly pity me<br />
For I was a god-damn fool in the port o’ Liverpool<br />
On the voyage when I first paid off from sea</p>
<p><strong>Oh Maggie Maggie May, they have taken you away</strong><br />
<strong>For to slave upon Van Dieman’s cruel shore</strong><br />
<strong>Oh, you robbed many a sailor, and many a drunken whaler</strong><br />
<strong>But you’ll never cruise down Paradise Street no more!</strong></p>
<p>I paid off at the Home, after a voyage from Sierra Leone<br />
Two pound ten a month had been my pay;<br />
As I jingled in me tin, I was sadly taken in<br />
By a lady of the name of Maggie May</p>
<p>When I steered into her, I hadn’t got a care<br />
I was cruisin’ up and down old Canning Place;<br />
She was in a gown so fine, like a frigate of the line,<br />
And bein’ a sailorman, I gave her chase</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>She gave me a saucy nod, and like a farmer’s clod<br />
I let her take me line abreast in tow<br />
An’ under all plain sail, we ran before the gale<br />
An’ to the Crow’s Nest Tavern we did go</p>
<p>Next mornin’ when I woke, I found that I was broke<br />
I hadn’t got a penny to me name<br />
So I had to pop me suit, me John Ls and me Boots<br />
Down in the Kelly Pawn Shop Number Nine</p>
<p><strong>Oh you theivin’ Maggie May, ye robbed me of my pay</strong><br />
<strong>When I slept with you that night ashore</strong><br />
<strong>Oh, guilty the jury found her, for robbin’ a homeward-bounder</strong><br />
<strong>And she’ll never roll down Paradise Street no more</strong></p>
<p>She was chained and sent away from Liverpool one day;<br />
The lads they cheered as she sailed down the Bay<br />
And every sailor lad, he only was too glad<br />
They’d sent the old gal out to Botany Bay!</p>
