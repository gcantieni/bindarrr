<h1>Saucy Sailor</h1>
<p>Come me own one, come me fair one<br />
Come now unto me<br />
Could ye fancy a poor sailor lad<br />
Who has just come from the sea?</p>
<p>Oh you’re ragged, love, and you’re dirty, love<br />
And your clothes smell much of tar<br />
So be gone you saucy sailor lad<br />
So be gone you Jack Tar</p>
<p>If I’m ragged, love, and I’m dirty, love<br />
And me clothes smell much of tar<br />
I have silver in me pocket, love<br />
And gold in great store</p>
<p>And then when she heard him say so<br />
On her bended knees she fell:<br />
I will marry my dear Henry,<br />
For I love the sailor lads so well!</p>
<p>Do you think that I, I am foolish love?<br />
Do you think that I am mad?<br />
For to wed with a poor country girl<br />
Where no fortune’s to be had?</p>
<p>I will cross the briny ocean,<br />
I will whistle and sing<br />
And since you’ve refused the offer, love,<br />
Some other girl shall wear the ring</p>
<p>I am frolicsome, and I am easy,<br />
Good-tempered and free<br />
And I don’t give a single pin, me boys,<br />
What the world thinks of me</p>
<p><em>(round) </em><br />
<em>La di da di da, la di da di da, </em><br />
<em>la di da di da da da</em></p>
