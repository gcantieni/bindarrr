<h1>Seven Drunken Nights</h1>
<p><strong>As I came home on aMondaynight as drunk as drunk could be </strong><br />
I saw a horse outside the door where my own horse should be<br />
<strong>So, I called me wife and I said "Hey Wife, will explain to me </strong><br />
Who owns that horse outside the door where my own horse should be?"<br />
<strong><em>Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool, so you can not see </em></strong><br />
<em>Why that's the lovely dairy cow me mother gave to me</em><br />
<strong>Well, it's many a day I've travelled a hundred miles or more </strong><br />
But a dairy cow with saddle on I’ve never seen before</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong><br />
I saw a coat behind the door where my own coat should be<br />
Who owns that coat behind the door where my own coat should be?"<br />
<em>That's the lovely blanket that me mother gave to me </em><br />
But a blanket with buttons on I’ve never seen before</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong><br />
I saw a pipe upon the chair where my own pipe should be<br />
Who owns that pipe upon the chair where my own pipe should be?"<br />
<em>That's the lovely tin whistle that me mother gave to me</em><br />
But a tin whistle with tobacco in it, I’ve never seen before</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong><br />
I saw two boots beside the bed where my own boots should be<br />
Who owns those boots beside the bed where my own boots should be?"<br />
<em>They’re lovely Geranium pots me mother gave to me </em><br />
But Geranium pots with laces on I’ve never seen before</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong><br />
I saw a head upon the bed where my own head should be<br />
Who owns that head upon the bed where my own head should be?"<br />
<em>That's a lovely baby boy me mother gave to me </em><br />
But a baby boy with whiskers on I’ve never seen before</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong><br />
I saw two mits upon the tits where my own mits should be<br />
Who owns those mits upon the tits where my old mits should be?"<br />
<em>That's the lovely lace brassiere that me mother gave to me </em><br />
But a lace brassiere with fingernails on I’ve never seen before</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong><br />
I saw a man inside the land where my own man should be<br />
Who owns that owns that man inside the land where my own man should be?"<br />
<em>That's the lovely shillelagh me mother gave to me </em><br />
But a shillelagh with bullocks on I’ve never seen before</p>
