<h1>Take It From Day To Day</h1>
<p>Stan Rogers</p>
<p>Well it’s not the hours of watch on watch and it’s not the work that I mind so much<br />
Or the long cold miles from my lover’s touch, though for sure she’s far away<br />
No stranger I to the touch of steel, nor the honest fear any man can feel<br />
But I long for dust under my heels and a pocket full of pay<br />
So I’ll take it from day to day</p>
<p>The pack-ice ’round us cracks and groans, the old St. Roch, she creaks and moans<br />
The icy fog is in my bones and the ache won’t go away<br />
Outside I bet it’s warm and fair, I could have her fingers in my hair<br />
But it’s long cold miles to her out there, so I guess I’ll have to stay<br />
And just take it from day to day</p>
<p>We’re as far north now as I want to come, but Larson’s got us under his thumb<br />
And I signed up for the whole damn run, I can’t get off halfway<br />
But when I get back onto the shore I’m going south where it stays warm<br />
And there’ll be someone on my arm to help me spend my pay<br />
So I’ll take it from day to day <em>(repeat final verse)</em></p>
