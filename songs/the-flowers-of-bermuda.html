<h1>The Flowers Of Bermuda</h1>
<p>Stan Rogers</p>
<p><strong>(S)he was the captain of the Nightingale </strong><br />
<strong>Twenty-one days from Clyde in coal </strong><br />
<strong>(S)he could smell the flowers of Bermuda in the gale </strong><br />
<strong>When (s)he died on the North Rock shoal </strong></p>
<p>Just five short hours from Bermuda<br />
In a fine October gale<br />
There came a cry, " Oh, there be breakers dead ahead<br />
From the collier Nightingale<br />
No sooner had the captain brought her round,<br />
Came a rending crash below<br />
Hard on her beam ends groaning, went the Nightingale<br />
And oâ€™erside her mainmast goes</p>
<p>"O captain are we all for drowning,"<br />
Came a cry from all the crew<br />
"The boats be smashed! How are we all then to be saved?<br />
They are stove in through and through<br />
O are ye brave and hardy colliermen<br />
Or are you blind and cannot see<br />
The captain's gig still lies before ye whole and sound<br />
And it shall carry all of we</p>
<p>But when the crew was all assembled<br />
And the gig prepared for sea<br />
'Twas seen there were but eighteen places to be manned<br />
Nineteen mortal souls were we<br />
But cries the captain, <em>"Now do not delay </em><br />
<em>Nor do you spare a thought for me </em><br />
<em>My duty is to save you all now if I can </em><br />
<em>See ye return quick as can be!"</em></p>
<p>Oh, there be flowers in Bermuda<br />
Beauty lies on every hand<br />
And there be laughter ease and drink for every man<br />
But there is no joy for me<br />
For when we reached the wretched Nightingale<br />
What an awful sight was plain<br />
The captain, drowned, was tangled in the mizzen chains<br />
Smiling bravely beneath the sea</p>
