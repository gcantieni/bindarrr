# Adieu, Sweet Lovely Nancy  

Adieu, sweet lovely Nancy, ten thousand times adieu  
I’m going across the ocean, love, to seek for something new.  
Come change your ring with me, dear girl, come change your ring with me  
That it might be a token of true love while I am on the sea.   

And when I am across the sea, you’ll know not where I am.  
Kind letters I will write to you from every foreign land.  
The secrets of your heart, dear girl, are the best of my good will,  
And let my body be where it might, my heart is with you still.  

There’s a heavy storm a-rising; see how it gathers ‘round  
While we poor souls on the ocean wide are fighting for the crown.  
**Our officers commanding us and them we must obey**  
**Expecting every moment for to get cast away.** (NOTE:  The bold portions may be skipped in order to cut out a verse. In that case, the first half of the third verse and the second half of the fourth verse are combined.)  

**There are tinkers, tailors, and shoemakers, lie snoring fast asleep**  
**While we poor souls on the ocean wide are plowing up the deep.**  
There’s nothing to protect us, love, or to keep us from the cold  
On the ocean wide where we must bide, like jolly seamen bold.  

But when these wars are over there’ll be peace on every shore.  
We’ll return to our wives and our families and the girls that we adore.  
We’ll call for liquor merrily and we’ll spend our money free,  
And when our money it is all gone, we will boldly go to sea.  


# All For Me Grog  

**It’s all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog **  
**It’s all gone for beer and tobacco **  
**Well I spent all me tin on the lassies drinking gin **  
**And across the western ocean I must wander **  

Where is me shirt, me noggy noggy shirt? / It’s…   
The collar’s all worn out and the front is kicked about   
And my tails are looking out for better weather   
   
Where are me boots, me noggy noggy boots?   
They’ve all gone for beer and tobacco   
The leather’s all worn out and the soles are all worn out   
And my toes are looking out for better weather   
    
Where is me bed, me noggy noggy bed? / It’s…   
I loant it to a whore and now it’s all a-wore   
And the springs are looking out for better weather   
   
Where is me wench, me noggy noggy wench? / She’s…   
Her lips is all worn out and her front is kicked about   
And her tail is looking out for better weather   
   
Where is me man, me noggy noggy man? / He’s…   
Well he spends all his time with the women and the wine   
So I think that I shall push him over yonder   
   
Where is me whore, me noggy noggy whore? / She’s…   
It’s her I want to lay, but she says I cannot pay   
So my whore is looking out for richer sailors   
   
**It’s all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog **  
**It’s all gone for beer and tobacco **  
**Well I spent all me loot in a house of ill repute **  
**And I think that I shall go back there tomorrow **  
   
Well I’m sick in the head, and I haven’t been to bed,   
Since first I came ashore with me plunder,   
I’ve seen centipedes and snakes, and I’m full of pains and aches,   
And I think that I shall push out over yonder   
   
Well me money was a-spent, and so off to see we went,   
And the ocean looked like whiskey, ‘twas an omen,   
Well we set off for Cathay, but we washed up far away,   
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond  

# Amble Town (Home Dearie Home)  
Recorded by Ed Trickett  

O Amble is a fine town with ships about the bay  
It's fain and very fain to be there myself today  
I'm wishing in my heart I was far away from here  
Sitting in my parlor and talking with my dear  

**And it's home, dearie, home, it's home I want to be**  
**My topsails are hoisted and I am out to sea**  
**The oak and the ash and the bonnie birchen tree**  
**Are all a-growing green in the North country**  
**And it's home, dearie, home**  

A letter came today, but somehow I cannot speak  
And the proud and happy tears are a-rolling down my cheeks  
There's someone here, she says, you've been waiting for to see  
With your merry hazel eyes, looking up from off my knee  

But the letter never said if we have a boy or girl  
Got me so confused that my heart is all a whirl  
So I'm going back to port, where I'll quickly turn around  
And take the fastest ship, which to Ambletown is bound  

Well, if it be a girl, she shall wear a golden ring  
If it be a boy, he shall live to serve the King  
With his buckles and his boot and his little jacket blue  
He'll walk the quarterdeck, like his daddy used to do  

# A-Rovin’  
In Amsterdam there lived a maid  
**Mark well what I do say **  
In Amsterdam there lived a maid   
And she was mistress of her trade   
**I’ll go no more a-rovin’ with you, fair maid**   

**A-rovin’, a-rovin’, since rovin’s been my ru-i-n **  
**I’ll go no more a-rovin’ with you, fair maid **  

Her lips were red her eyes were brown…   
Her hair was black and hanging down…   

These last ten months I’d been to sea   
And Hell, this gal looked good to me   

I took this maid out for a walk   
And we had such a lovely talk   

And on this walk on which we went  
She clearly gave me her consent   

I took her hand within my own   
Said she, "It’s time that I was home"   

I put my hand upon her knee   
Said she, "Young man, you’re rather free"   

I put my hand around her waist   
Said she, "Young man, you’re in great haste"   

I put my hand upon her thigh   
Said she, "Young man, you’re rather high"   

I put my hand upon her breast   
We did the dance she does the best   

But when me money all was spent   
’Twas off to sea I gladly went   

# Auld Triangle  

A hungry feeling came o'er me stealing   
And the mice were squealing in my prison cell   

**And the old triangle went jingle jangle **  
**All along the banks of the royal canal**  

To begin the morning the screw was bawling   
"Get up, ya bowsie, and clean up your cell"   

The screw was peeping, Humpy Gussy was sleeping   
As I lay there dreaming of my girl, Sal   

Up in the female prison there are seventy-five women   
And 'tis among them I wish I did dwell  

# The Ball Of Kerrymuir  

Four and twenty virgins came down from Inverness  
And when the ball was over there were four and twenty less!  

**Singing balls to your partner; your ass against the wall**  
**If you’ve never been had on a Saturday night, you’ve never been had at all.**  

There was doin’ in the parlor, and doin’ on the stones  
You couldn’t hear the music for the wheezin’ and the moans  

The village economist he was there, his prick held in his hand  
Waitin’ for the moment when supply would meet demand  

The village postman he was there, but the poor man had the pox  
He couldn’t do the lassies, so he did the letter box   

Anne Boleyn was also there, even though she’s dead  
She’s terrific on her back, me boys, but better giving head!  

Pinocchio was also there, and quite a sight to see  
The ladies sat upon his face and shouted, "Lie to me!"  

The village magician, he was there; he gave us all a laugh  
He pulled his foreskin over his head and vanished up his ass!  


# The Ballad Of Captain Kidd  

My name is Captain Kidd **as I sailed, as I sailed**  
**My name is Captain Kidd as I sailed.**  
**My name is Captain Kidd**, and wickedly I did  
And wickedly I did **as I sailed, as I sailed**  
**And wickedly I did as I sailed.**  

My parents taught me well…  
**My parents taught me** **well** to shun the gates of Hell  
But against them I rebelled…  

I’d a Bible in my hand…  
**I’d a Bible in my hand; **I sunk it in the sand  
Before I left the strand…  

I spied three ships of Spain…  
**I spied three ships of Spain**; I fired on them the main  
‘Til all three crew was slain…  

I’d eighty bars of gold…  
**I’d eighty bars of gold **and dollars in the hold  
And riches uncontrolled…  

I murdered William Moore…  
**I murdered William Moore **and left him in his gore  
Full forty leagues from shore…  

O’ertaken now at last…  
**O’ertaken now at last** and into prison cast  
And sentence being passed…  

To execution dock **I must go, I must go**  
**To execution dock I must go**  
**To execution dock** while thousands ‘round me flock  
To see me on the block **as I go, as I go**  
**To see me on the block as I go**.  

**They called me Captain Kidd as I sailed, as I sailed.**  
**They called me Captain Kidd, and wickedly I did**  
**And wickedly I did as I sailed, as I sailed.**  



# Baltimore Whores  

There were four old whores from Baltimore   
Drinking beer and wine.   
The topic of conversation was   
"Yours is smaller than mine."  

**Roly, poly, tickle my hole-y,**  
**Smell of my slimy slough.**  
**Then drag your nuts across my guts,**  
**I'm one of the whorey crew. **  

The first old whore from Baltimore said,   
"Mine's as big as the air.   
The birds fly in, the birds fly out,   
And never touch a hair."    

The second old whore from Baltimore said,   
"Mine's as big as the moon.   
The men jump in, the men jump out,   
And never touch the womb."    

The third old whore from Baltimore said,   
"Mine's as big as the sea.   
The ships sail in, the ships sail out,   
And leave their rigging free."    

The fourth old whore from Baltimore said,   
"Mine's the biggest of all.   
A man went up in the springtime,   
And didn't come out till fall."

# Barrett's Privateers   
Stan Rogers  

Oh, the year was 1778   
**How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now**   
A letter of marque came from the king   
To the scummiest vessel I’d ever seen   

**God damn them all! **  
**I was told we’d cruise the seas for American gold **  
**We’d fire no guns, shed no tears **  
**Now I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier **  
**The last of Barrett’s privateers**   

Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town…   
For twenty brave men, all fishermen who   
Would make for him the Antelope’s crew   

The Antelope’s sloop was a sickening sight...  
She’d a list to the port and her sails in rags   
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags   

On the King’s birthday we put to sea...  
We were ninety-one days to Montego Bay   
Pumping like madmen all the way   

On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again...  
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight   
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight   

The Yankee lay low down with gold...  
She was broad and fat and loose in stays   
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days   

Then at length we stood two cables away...  
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din   
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in   

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side...  
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs   
And the main truck carried off both me legs   

So here I lay in my twenty-third year...  
It’s been six years since we sailed away   
And I just made Halifax yesterday  

# Ben Backstay  

Ben Backstay was our boatswain, a very merry boy   
For no one half so merrily, could pipe all hands ahoy   
And when unto his summons, we did not well attend   
No lad than he more merrily, could handle the rope’s end  
**Could han-dle the rope****’****s end, could han-dle the rope’s end**  

**Singing chip chow cherry chow fol de riddle idle ow**  
**Chip chow cherry chow fol de riddle day (x2)**  

While sailing once our Captain, who was a jolly dog  
Served out to all our company, a double share of grog   
Ben Backstay he got tipsy, all to his heart’s content   
And he being half seas over, boys, right overboard he went  
**Right o-ver-board he went, right o-ver-board he went**  

A shark was on the starboard bow, and sharks no man can stand    
For they do grapple everything, just like your sharks on land   
We heaved Ben out some tackling, to give his life some hope    
But as the shark bit his head off, so he couldn't see the rope  
**So he could-n’t see the rope, he could-n’t see the rope**  

Without his head his ghost appeared, all on the briny lake   
He piped all hands ahoy and cried, "Lads warning by me take   
By drinking grog I lost my life, and you my fate could meet   
So never mix your rum me lads, but always take them neat  
**But al-ways take them neat, but al-ways take them neat**  

# The Bergen  

Jez Lowe  

Sleep, why’d you wake me with these dreams you bring?  
**Dreams came to me where I lay**  
And deep the melodies the wild waves sing  
**My love is far, far away**  

**Oh, pity the hearts**  
**The wild waves part**  
**My love sails the bonny barque**  
**The Bergen**  

They heap their nets upon the decks by light  
And creep out gentle in the dead of night  

They reap their harvest from the cold night sea  
It leaps with herring ‘neath his decks for me  

Steep waves rise above his cold, fair head  
Oh keep him safe to lie here in my bed!  

It weeps with rain tonight where my love lies  
It sweeps the foreign sands from out his eyes  

# Black Is The Color Of My True Love’s Hair  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

Black is the color of my true love's hair  
Her lips are red like some roses fair  
The purest eyes and the gentlest hands  
I love the ground whereon she stands  

I go to Clyde for to mourn and weep  
But satisfied I never can sleep  
I'll write to you in a few short lines  
I'll suffer death ten thousand times  

I love my love and well she knows  
I love the grass whereon she goes  
If she on earth no more I see  
My life will quickly fade away from me  

*Optional:*  
*(A winter's past and the leaves are green*  
*The time has past that we have seen*  
*But still I pray the time will come*  
*When she and I will be as one)*  

Black is the color of my true love's hair  
Her lips are like some roses fair  
The purest eyes and the gentlest hands  
I love the ground whereon she stands  

*Optional Ending: *  
*Black is the color of my true love’s hair*  
*Her lips are like some roses fair *  
*The purest hands and the gentlest eyes*  
*I love the ground wherein she lies *  

# Black Velvet Band  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

In a neat little town they call Belfast  
Apprenticed to trade I was bound  
And many an hour’s sweet happiness  
I spent in that neat little town  
’Til sad misfortune befell me  
And caused me to stray from the land  
Far away from my friends and relations  
To follow the black velvet band  

**Her eyes they shone like the diamonds**  
**You’d think she was queen of the land**  
**And her hair hung over her shoulder**  
**Tied up with a black velvet band**  

When I was out strolling one evening  
Not meaning to go very far  
When I met with a frolicsome damsel  
She was plying her trade in a bar  
When a watch she took from a customer  
And slipped it right into my hand  
Then the law came and put me in prison  
Bad luck to the Black Velvet Band  

Next morning before judge and jury  
At trial I had to appear  
The judge says to me, "me young fellow  
The case against you is quite clear  
And seven long years is your sentence  
You’re going to Van Diemen’s Land  
Far away from your friends and relations  
To follow the black velvet band"  

So come all you jolly young fellows  
I’ll have you take warning by me  
Whenever you’re out on the liquor, me boys  
Beware of the pretty colleens  
They’ll fill you with whiskey and porter  
’Til you are not able to stand  
And the very next thing that you know, me lads  
You’ve landed in Van Diemen’s Land  
  

# Blackthorn  
By Splinter-Eye  

**Blackthorn, carry me home,**  
**For it's down the hedgerows I will travel.**  
**Blackened skin and poison thorns,**  
**Blackthorn, carry me home.**  
**Oh, blackthorn, carry me home.**  

I went on the back roads and there did see  
There did see a rosary,  
A poor old mother on her hands and knees.  
Blackthorn, carry me home.  

She wept on the ground where the bright sun shone.  
The bright sun shone, on and on.  
"I had three children, they are dead and gone."  
Blackthorn, carry me home.  

I cut a branch of the poison thorns,  
Poison thorns like the devil's horns,  
A staff for to carry me 'til the morn.  
Blackthorn, carry me home.  

# Blood Red Roses  

Our boots and shoes are all in pawn   
**Go down, you blood red roses, go down **  
It’s flaming drafty ’round Cape Horn   
**Go down, you blood red roses, go down **  
** **  
**Ah, you pinks and posies**   
**Go down, you blood red roses, go down **  
   
It’s ’round Cape Horn with frozen sail…   
Around Cape Stiff to hunt for whale…   
   
It’s ’round Cape Horn the ship must go   
For that is where them whalefishes blow   
   
It’s growl you may but go you must   
You growl too hard your head they’ll bust   
   
The topman at the mate he roars   
"It’s lay aloft, you lazy whores!"   
   
Rock and shake her is the cry   
The bleeding topmast sheave is dry   
   
Just one more pull and that will do   
For we’re the boys to kick her through  

# Blow The Man Down   

As I was a-walkin’ down Paradise Street   
*(To me!)* **Way, hey, blow the man down**   
A pretty young damsel I chanced for to meet   
**Give me some time to blow the man down**   

She was round in the corner and bluff in the bow…   
So I took in all sail and cried "Way enough now"…   

I threw out my hawser and took her in tow   
And yardarm to yardarm away did we go   

She said to me "Sir, will you stand for the treat?"   
"Delighted," says I, “for a charmer so sweet”   

It was up in her quarters she piped me aboard   
And there on her bed I cut loose with my sword   

But just as my cutter was forging ahead   
She shouted "My husband!" and jumped out of bed   

He was seven feet tall, had a chest like a horse   
And right for my jawbone he plotted his course   

He loosened my rigging, he kicked me in stays   
I flew down the stairs like a ship on the way   

I chanced on a packet that happened on by   
And when I awoke I was bound for Shanghai   

So I’ll give you fair warning before we belay   
Don’t ever take heed of what pretty girls say  

# Blow Ye Winds In The Morning  

‘Tis advertised in Boston, New York and Buffalo  
Five hundred brave Americans, A-whaling for to go, singing  

**Blow, ye winds in the morning, blow, ye winds, high-ho!**  
**Clear away your running gear, and blow, boys, blow!**  

They send you to New Bedord, that famous whaling port,And give you to some land-sharks to board and fit you out.  

They send you to a boarding-house, there for a time to dwell;The thieves they there are thicker than the other side of hell!  

It's now we're out to sea, my boys, the wind comes on to blow;One half the watch is sick on deck, the other half below.  

The cooper's at the vise-bench, a-making iron poles,And the mate's upon the main hatch a-cursing all our souls.  

The Skipper's on the quarter-deck a-squinting at the sails,When up aloft the lookout sights a mighty school of whales.  

Now we have got him turned up, we tow him alongside;We over with our blubber-hooks and rob him of his hide.  

But now that our old ship is full and we don't give a damn,We'll bend on all our stu'nsails and sail for Yankee land.When we get home, our ship made fast, and we get through our sailing,A winding glass around we'll pass and damn this blubber whaling!  

# The Boatman’s Cure  
From Long-Hard Susan  

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Poling up the river in a three-hand boat,
Too deep to carry, too shallow to float,
Too deep to carry, too shallow to float.
     If it doesn't lift your spirits it'll leave you numb
     Best cure for the river is a bottle of rum,
     Best cure for the river is a bottle of rum.

Listen to the forwarder struttin' on the quay,
He's quick to tell the boatman how the river will be.
     …Best cure for the forwarder…

Workin' up the rift the current swung her round,
Bedbugs swum ashore, poor boatman nearly got drowned.
     …Best cure for bedbugs…

Sweatin' in the heat of day, chillin' in the rain,
Sleepin' in the open got the ague again.
     …Best cure for the ague…

Frostbite in November took my toes away,
Devil take the blackfly 'bout the last week in May.
     …Best cure for the blackfly…

Sweet Annie from Schenectady, she stole my heart,
Her face is in the firelight, the river sings her part.
     …Best cure for a woman…

I fought all through this wilderness in '59
Still fancy I see shadows moving most of the time.
     …Best cure for shadows…

Morning comes up early for a fast bateau,
Shoulder to the setting pole, you push off and go.
     …But there ain't no cure for living in a bottle of rum.</td>

# Bold Privateer  

Oh my dearest Molly, it's you and I must part  
I'm across the ocean, love - I'll leave you with my heart  
My ship is now awaiting, so fare thee well my dear  
I'm going onboard the vessel a bold privateer  

**Bold privateer, bold privateer**  
**I'm just now going onboard the bold privateer**  

Oh my dearest Johnny, great dangers have been wrought,  
And many's a sweet life on the sea has been lost  
Better stay at home with your charming Molly dear  
Then to venture your sweet life a bold privateer  

**Bold privateer, bold privateer**  
**Then to venture your sweet life a bold privateer**  

Oh my dearest Molly, your friends do me despise,  
Besides you have two brothers who'd freely take my life  
Come change your ring with me, dear love, come change your ring with me,  
And let it be a token when I'm across the sea  

**When I'm across the sea, when I'm across the sea**  
**And let it be a token when I'm across the sea.**  

And when the war is ended, should heaven spare my life  
I'll return again to my intended wife  
And then I'll get married to my charming Molly dear  
And forever bid adieu to the bold privateer  

**Bold privateer, bold privateer**  
**And forever bid adieu to the bold privateer.**  

# The Bonnie Ship the Diamond  
Transcribed by Meister Jaeger from The Watersons (1965)  

The Diamond is a ship, me lads, for the Davis Strait she’s bound  
And the quay it is all garnished with the bonnie lassies round  
Captain Thompson gives the orders to sail the whole world wide  
Where the sun it never sets, me lads, nor darkness dims the sky  

**And it’s cheer up, me lads, let your hearts never fail**  
**For the bonnie ship the Diamond goes a-fishin’ for the whale**  

Along the quay at Peterhead where the lassies stand around  
With their shawls all pulled about them and the salt tears running down  
Now don’t you weep my bonnie lass, though we leave you behind  
For the rose will grow on Greenland’s banks before we change our mind  

Here’s a health to the *Resolution*, likewise the *Eliza Swan*  
Here’s a health to the *Battler of the Montrose* (NOTE:  This probably refers to the Battler of Leigh.  See below.) and the *Diamond*, ship of fame (NOTE: According to http://mainlynorfolk.info/lloyd/songs/thebonnyshipthediamond.html, this ballad was written only a few years before all the ships mentioned here (except the Eliza Swan) were destroyed in a whaling expedition.)  
We wear the trousers of the white and the jackets of the blue  
When we come home to Peterhead, we’ll have sweethearts in you  

It will be bright both day and night when the Greenland lads come home  
With a ship that’s full of oil, me lads, and money of our own  
We’ll make the cradles for to rock and the blankets for to tear  
And every lass in Peterhead sings "Hushabye, my dear"  

# Boozing  

Now what are the joys of a single young man?   
**Why, boozing, bloody well boozing **  
And what is he doing whenever he can?   
**Why, boozing, bloody well boozing **  

You may think I’m wrong or you may think I’m right   
I’m not going to argue, I know you can’t fight   
But what do you think we are doing tonight?   
**Why, boozing, bloody well boozing **  

**Boozing, boozing, just you and I **  
**Boozing, boozing, when we are dry **  
**Some do it openly, some on the sly **  
**And we all are bloody well boozing **  

Oh what are the joys of a poor married man? **…**   
And what is he doing whenever he can? **…**   
He comes home at night and he gives his wife all   
He goes out a-shopping, makes many a call   
But what brings him home hanging on to the wall? **…**   

And what do the moral majority run down? **…**   
And what are they banning in every town? **…**   
They stand on street corners, they rave and they shout   
They shout about things they know nothing about   
But what are they doing when the lights are turned out? **…**   

# Bullgine  

Well the hardest packet you'll ever find  
**Ra hey ra ho are you most done**  
Is the old *Wildcat* of the Swallowtail line  
**Clear away the track and let the bullgine run**  

**Hey rig a jig in the low back car**  
**Ra hey ra ho are you most done**  
**Liza Lee all on my knee**  
**Clear away the track and let the bullgine run**  

Well Eliza Lee if you were mine  
I would dress you up in silk so fine  

Well the prettiest sight you'll ever see  
Is Eliza Lee all on my knee  

Well in Liverpool town them girls hang 'round  
And it’s there Eliza can be found  

And when we get to Liverpool town  
I will stand you whiskey all around  

Well when I come home from across the sea  
Oh, Eliza Lee will you marry me?  

Well I'll stay with you upon the shore  
And it's back to sea I'll go no more  

# Bully In The Alley  

**Help me, Bob, I’m bully in the alley **  
**Way, hey, bully in the alley **  
**Help me, Bob, I’m bully in the alley **  
**Bully down in Shinbone Al’ **  

Well, Sally is the girl that I love dearly   
**Way, hey, bully in the alley**   
Sally is the girl that I’d splice nearly   
**Bully down in Shinbone Al’**   

For seven long years I courted Sally…   
All she did was dilly in the dally…   

I bought her silks, I bought her laces   
I took her out to all the fine places   

Well, I’ll leave Sal and I’ll be a sailor   
I’ll leave Sal and ship aboard a whaler   

When I get back I’ll marry Sally   
We’ll have kids and count them by the tally  


# Bound for Amerikay  
Paul Lauzon, from Albatrossity  
   
Come all ye and listen to a tale that is true  
The Liverpool paper said, "Men we need you  
Young men and strong come sign up today  
In the morning we’re bound for Amerikay"  
   
So I says to the captain Mr. Plato Denney,  
"Sir, I crave to be free of this poverty"  
He said, "Sign here young man, come give us a hand  
In seven short years you will own your own land"  
   
**Chorus:**  
**Hey boys, won’t you sing us a song**  
**Hey boys, to last the whole night long**  
**Ah love, don’t you turn me away**  
**In the morning I’m bound for Amerikay**  
** **  
We set sail from Liverpool across the wide sea  
In April of seventeen hundred and seventy  
Thirty-eight men, no children, no wives  
Bound for the new world to make new lives  
   
Hail, sleet and rain, a confused angry sea  
With close smelling quarters – you had to fight just to breathe  
Weary and wasted sailors we were  
Eating salt beef and biscuits with water and vinegar  
   
**Chorus**  
** **  
In summer we landed on Campobell’ Isle  
And they put us to work in a very short while  
Building houses and barns, planting turnips and grain  
And fishing for cod in the wind and the rain  
   
Oh, the masters were hard as my calluses showed  
It was us made them rich but still debts we owed  
We’d work from the dust to the late setting sun  
But at night we’d forget with our spruce beer and rum  
   
**Chorus**  
** **  
In seventeen hundred and seventy two  
We ambushed the captain and told him we were through  
Of slaving for nothing in a land not our own  
And at gunpoint we told him you’re taking us back home  
   
We set sail for Liverpool, ‘twas late in the year  
Each role of the ship, we let out a cheer  
Free men at last, ourselves in command  
But our good ship went down just after Newfoundland  
   
**Chorus**  
# Cape Cod Girls / Heave Away / Bound For Australia  

Cape Cod boys don’t got no sleds  
**Heave away, heave away**  
They slide down hills on codfish heads  
**For we’re bound for Australia**  

**Heave away me bonny bonny boys**  
**Heave away, heave away**  
**Heave away and don’t you make a noise**  
**For we’re bound for Australia**  

Cape Cod girls don’t got no combs…  
They comb their hair with codfish bones  

Cape Cod moms don’t bake no pies  
They feed their children codfish eyes  

Cape Cod cats don’t got no tails  
They lost them all in Cape Cod gales  

Cape Cod dogs don’t got no bite  
They lost it barking at the Cape Cod light  

Cape Cod doctors got no pills  
They give their patients codfish gills  

Cape Cod ladies don’t give no thrills  
They’re plain and skinny as the codfish gills  

# Chicken On A Raft  

Skipper’s in the wardroom drinking gin   
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft**  
I don’t mind knocking, but I ain’t going in!    
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft**   
The Jimmy’s laughing like a drain,   
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft**   
He’s looking at me "comic cuts" again!    
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft**   
   
**Chicken on a raft on a Monday morning**   
**Oh, what a terrible sight to see**   
**’Dabtoe’s for’ard and the dustman’s aft**   
**Sittin’ there pickin’ at a chicken on a raft**   
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft **  
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft **  
   
Gave me the middle and the forenoon too   
And now I’m pulling in the whaler’s crew   
Seagulls wheeling overhead   
I oughter be home in me featherbed   
   
I had a little girl in Donny-Bee   
And did she make a fool of me   
Her heart was like a pusser’s shower,   
Run hot to cold in a quarter of an hour   
   
I had a little girl lived in Dumfries   
Only had her kids in twos and threes   
Her sister lives in Maryhill   
Says she won’t, (And I respect her free will!) (And I respect her decision!) (And I think she won’t!)   

# The Coasts Of High Barbary  

Look ahead, look astern,  
Look the weather and the lee  
**Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we**  
I see a wreck to windward,   
And a lofty ship to lee,  
**A-sailing down along the coasts of High Barbary**  

"Oh, are you a pirate  
Or a man-o'-war?" cried he...  
"Oh no, we are not men of war,  
But men of ARRR!!!" cried we...  

Well back up your topsails  
And heave your vessel to...  
For we have got some letters  
To be carried home by you...  

We'll back up our topsails  
And heave our vessel to...  
But only in some harbour  
And along the side of you...  

For broadside for broadside  
We fought all on the main...  
Until at last the pirate  
Shot the frigate's mast away...  

"For quarters! For quarters!"  
The saucy sailors cried...  
The quarters that we showed them  
Was to sink them in the tide...  

With cutlass and gun  
Oh, we fought for hours three...  
Their ship it was their coffin,  
And their grave it was the sea...  

# Cockles And Mussels  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty  
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone  
As she wheeled her wheel-barrow  

**Through streets broad and narrow**  
**Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o!"**  
**Alive, alive-o, alive, alive-o!**  
**Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o!"**  

She was a fishmonger, but sure 'twas no wonder  
For so were her father and mother before  
And they each wheeled their barrow  
**Through…**  

She died of a faver, and no one could save her  
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone  
But her ghost wheels her barrow  
**Through…**  

# Collier’s Song  

**I can hew, boys, I can hack it out **  
**I can hew the coal, I can dance and shout **  
**I can hew, boys, coal so black and fine **  
**I’m a collier lad, working down the mine **  
** **  
It’s Saint Monday’s day, and well I do admire   
To sit snug at home by my own coal fire   
Then it’s down to the pub for a pint or two   
For to work on Monday, that would never do   
   
Now my son’s fourteen, he’s a strapping lad   
He’ll go down to the mine just like his dad   
And when Friday comes we’ll pick up our pay   
And we’ll drink together to round out the day   
   
Well, I likes me whiskey and I likes me beer   
I’ll drink fourteen pints and I’ll not feel queer   
I can hold my liquor as well as any man   
And I’ll dance and sing as long as I can   
   
And it’s when I die then I know full well   
I’ll not go to Heaven, I am bound for Hell   
And my pick and shovel, Old Nick he will admire   
And he’ll set me to hewing coal for his own Hellfire  

# Come Get Your Duds In Order  

Come get your duds in order, for we’re going to leave tomorrow  
**Heave away, me jollies, heave away**  
Come get your duds in order, for we’re going to cross the water  
**Heave away, me jolly boys, we’re all bound away**  

Sometimes we’re bound for Liverpool; sometimes we’re bound for Spain  
Sometimes we’re bound for St. Johns Town to watch the girls a-dancing  
Now it's farewell Maggie darling for its now I’m going to leave you  
You promised me you’d marry me but how you did deceive me  
I wrote me love a letter and I signed it with ring  
I wrote me love a letter; I was on the Jenny Lind  

My love wrote me a letter as I sailed the great blue sea   
My love wrote me a letter she won't wait at home for me  

In St. John's town we have good fun we watch the girls-a-dancing  
And when I've all drunk off all me glass you'll find me there a-prancing  
Sometimes we’re bound for Liverpool, sometimes we’re bound for Spain  
But now we're bound for St. Johns Town to watch the girls a-dancing  

# Congo River  

Was you ever on the Congo River?  
**Blow, boys, blow**  
Where fever makes the sailor shiver  
**Blow me bully boys, blow**  

A Yankee ship came down the river…  
Her masts and yards they shone like silver…  

How d’you know she’s a Yankee clipper?  
By the blood an’ guts that flow from her scuppers  

Yonder came the Arrow packet  
She fired her guns an’ I heard the racket   

And who do you think was the skipper of her?  
It’s old Bully Hayes; he’s a sailor robber  

And who do you think was chief mate of her?  
Why Boss-eyed Bill the Bowery Bastard  

And what do you think that they had for breakfast?  
The starboard side of an old sou’wester  

And what do you think that they had for dinner?  
A monkey’s heart and a donkey’s liver  

And what do you think that they had for supper?  
Belaying pin pie and a roll in the scupper  

Blow today and blow tomorrow  
And blow me from this ship of sorrow  

Blow today and blow forever  
And blow me down the Congo River  

# Courting In The Kitchen  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

Come single belle and beau, to me now pay attention  
And love, I’ll plainly show, is the devil’s own invention  
For once I fell in love with a damsel so bewitchin’  
Miss Henrietta Bell, down in Captain Kelly’s kitchen  

**To me toora loora la, to me toora loora laddy**  
**To me toora loora la, and me toora loora laddy**  

At the age of seventeen I was ’prenticed to a grocer  
Not far from Stephen’s Green where Miss Bell she used to go, sir  
Her manners were so free, she set my heart a-twitchin’  
And she invited me to a hooley in the kitchen  

Next Sunday being the day we were to have the flare-up  
I dressed myself quite gay and I frizzed and oiled my hair up  
The Captain had no wife, and he had gone a-fishin’  
So we kicked up high life down belowstairs in the kitchen  

Just as the clock struck six we sat down to the table  
She handed tea and cakes and I ate while I was able  
I drank hot punch and tea ’til my side had got a stitch in  
And the hours passed quick ‘way when you’re courting in the kitchen  

With my arms around her waist, she slyly hinted marriage  
When to the door in haste came Captain Kelly’s carriage  
Her eyes were full of hate and poison she was spittin’  
The captain kicked the door in and he stormed into the kitchen  

She flew up off my knees, full five feet up or higher  
And over heads and heels threw me slap in to the fire  
My new Repealers coat that I’d bought from Mr. Mitchum  
With a twenty-shilling note went to blazes in the kitchen  

I grieved to see my duds all smeared with soot and ashes  
When a tub of dirty suds right in my face she dashes  
As I lay on the floor and the water she kept pitchin’  
The footman broke the door and walked right in to the kitchen  

I said she did invite me, but she gave flat denial  
For assault she did indict me, and I was sent for trial  
She swore I robbed the house, in spite of all her screechin’  
And I got six months hard for my courting in the kitchen  

# The Crawl  
(from Sir Chauncey Bonnet, Esq.)  

**Well, we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between.**It all began one afternoon on the shores of Ambleside,We were sittin' there quite peacefully with the rising of the tide;When an idea it came to mind for to usher in the Fall,So we all agreed next Friday night we'd go out on the crawl.We planned to have a gay old time, the cash we did not spare,We left all the cars at home and paid the taxi fare;I got out to Horseshoe Bay a little after five,From a table in the corner I heard familiar voices rise.Spirits they ran high that night, old stories we did share,Of the days when we were younger men and never had a care;The beer flowed like a river and we drank the keg near dry,So we drained down all our glasses and were thirsty by-and-by.Park Royal Hotel, The Rusty Gull, Square-Rigger and Queen's Cross,We'd started out with eight good boys but half had gotten lost;For you'll never keep the lads together when their eyes begin to rove,So there was just the three of us that made it to Deep Cove.We arrived out at The Raven just in time for the last call,The final destination of this the first annual crawl;We dug deep into our pockets there was no money to be found,Nine miles home and for walking we are bound.  

# The Crayfish  

"Fisherman, fisherman, standing by the sea,Have you a crayfish that you can sell to me?"**By the wayside i-diddle-****i****-doh.**"Yes sir, yes sir, that indeed I do.I've got a crayfish that I can sell to you."Well, I took him on home and I thought he'd like a swim,So I filled up the thunderjug and I threw the bugger in.Late that night I thought I'd have a fitWhen my old lady got up to *wash her face*."Husband, husband," she cried out to me,"The devil's in the thunderjug and he's got hold of me!""Children, children, bring the looking glass.Come and see the crayfish that bit your mother's *a-face*""Children, children, did you hear the grunt?Come and see the crayfish that bit your mother's *nose*”  

That's the end of my song and there isn’t anymore.I’ve an apple in me pocket and you can have the core.  

( *alternate: )*  
That's the end of my song and I don't give a fuck.There's a lemon up my asshole and you can have a suck.  

# Danny Boy  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen, and down the mountainside.  
The summer's gone, and all the leaves are falling.  
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,  
For I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow.  
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so.  

But if you come, and all the flowers are dying  
And if I'm dead, as dead I well may be.  
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.  
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,  
And o'er my grave shall warmer, sweeter be,  
And if you bend and tell me that you love me,  
Then I shall sleep in peace until you come to me.  

# Oh, Dear Grog  
   
It’s of dear grog to you I’ll sing,   
And to dear grog I’ll always cling,   
I like my cup filled to the brim,    
And I’ll drink all you’d like to bring.   
   
**And it’s oh, dear grog, thou art my darling, **  
**And my joy both night and morning. **  
   
If all the rest of Adam’s race   
Was assembled in this place,   
I’d part with all without one tear   
Before I’d part with you, my dear   
   
The brewer brewed thee in his pan,   
The tapster drew thee in his can,   
Now I with thee will play my part,   
And lodge thee ever near my heart   
   
And if my wife should me despise,   
By Jove, I’d pluck out both her eyes,   
But if she loved me as I love thee,   
A happy couple we would be   
   
Though oft hast made my friends my foes,    
And oft hast made me pawn my clothes,   
But since thou art so near my nose,   
It’s up, me boys, and down she goes   
   
Now since this liquor’s all drunk up,   
Methinks to you I’ll hand this cup,   
And when you’ve filled it up with sling,   
I’ll drink your health all ‘round again  

# Dental Dams  
(conceived by Busty Boots and Scrimshaw Bootystache)  

Oh, dental dams, you are so great,  
I would use you on a first date.  

Oh dental dams protect my teeth  
When I go down underneath.  

Folly-rolly-ri-ee  
Folly-rolly-ree,  
Dental dams you’re the one for me,  

Folly-rolly-ri-eeFolly-rolly-ree,  
Lick the vagina, one-two-three!  


# Donkey Riding  
Great Big Sea  
   
**Way hey and away we go **  
**Donkey riding, donkey riding **  
**Way hey and away we go **  
**Ridin' on a donkey. **  
   
Was you ever in Quebec   
Launchin' timber on the deck?   
Where ya break yer bleedin' neck   
Ridin' on a donkey!   
   
**Way hey and away we go…**   
   
Was you ever 'round Cape Horn   
Where the weather's never warm?   
Wished to God you'd never been born   
Ridin' on a donkey.   
   
Was you ever in Miramichi   
Where ye tie up to a tree,   
An' the girls sit on yer knee?   
Ridin' on a donkey   
   
Was you ever in Fortune Bay   
See the girls all shout, "Hooray!"?   
"Here comes dad with ten weeks pay   
Riding on a donkey."   
   
Was you ever in London-town   
See the King he does come down?   
*See the King in his golden crown! *  
Riding on a donkey   

# Don’t Forget Your Old Shipmate  

Safe and sound at home again, let the waters roar, Jack.  
Safe and sound at home again, let the waters roar, Jack.  

**Long we've tossed on the rolling main, now we're safe ashore, Jack.**  
**Don't forget yer old shipmate, faldee raldee raldee raldee rye-eye-doe!**  

Since we sailed from Plymouth Sound, four years gone, or nigh, Jack.  
Was there ever chummies, now, such as you and I, Jack?  

We have worked the self-same gun, quarterdeck division.  
Sponger I and loader you, through the whole commission.  

Oftentimes have we laid out, toil nor danger fearing,  
Tugging out the flapping sail to the weather earring.  

When the middle watch was on, and the time went slow, boy,  
Who could choose a rousing stave, who like Jack or Joe, boy?  

There she swings, an empty hulk, not a soul below now.  
Number seven starboard mess misses Jack and Joe now.  

But the best of friends must part, fair or foul the weather.  
Hand yer flipper for a shake, now a drink together.  


# Down Among The Dead Men  
(from Captain Whatsit the Dreadful)  

Here’s a health to the Queen and a lasting peace:  
To faction an end; to wealth increase!  
Come let us drink while we have breath  
For there’s no drinking after death.  

**And he that will this health deny**  
**Down among the dead men, down among the dead men**  
**Down, down, down, down**  
**Down among the dead men let him lie!**  

In smiling Bacchus’ joys I’ll roll;  
Deny no pleasure to my soul  
Let Bacchus’ health ‘round quickly move  
For Bacchus is a friend to love.  

Let love and wine their rights maintain  
And their united pleasures reign  
While Bacchus’ treasures crown the board,  
We’ll drink the joys that both afford!  

Here’s a health to the things that we hold dear:  
To those who would these us deny:  
May ye sadly live and sober die!  

# The Dreadnaught  

There is a flash packet and a packet of fame  
She hails from New York and the dreadnaught’s her name   
She’s bound to the west where the wide waters flow!  
Bound away to the westward in the Dreadnaught we go  
**Derry down, down, down derry down.**  

The time of her sailing is now drawing nigh  
Farewell pretty maids, we must bid you goodbye  
A pair of clean heels now to you we will show  
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go  

Now the Dreadnaught is lying in the river Mercy   
Awaiting the tugboat to tow her to sea   
For to round the rock light where the salt tides do flow  
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go   

Now the Dreadnaught’s a-bowlin down the wild Irish Sea  
Her passengers merry; their hearts full of glee  
Her sailors like tigers walk the decks to and fro  
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go  
Now the Dreadnaught’s a-sailing the Atlantic so wide  
While the dark, heavy seas roll along her black sides,  
With her tops’ls set taut for the red cross to show  
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go  

Now the dreadnaught’s arriving in old New York town  
We’re bound for the bow’ry and let sorrow drown  
With our gals and our beer, boys we’ll let the song flow!   
She’s a saucy flash packet; oh lord let her go!   

Here’s a health to the Dreadnaught and all her brave crew   
To bold captain Samuels and his officers too  
You may talk of your fliers Swallowtail and Black Ball  
But the Dreadnaught’s the packet that outsails them all!  









# A Drop Of Nelson’s Blood  

Oh a drop of Nelson’s Blood wouldn’t do me any harm  
Oh a drop of Nelson’s Blood wouldn’t do me any harm  
Oh a drop of Nelson’s Blood wouldn’t do me any harm  
**And we’ll all hang on behind**  

**And we’ll roll the old chariot along **  
**We’ll roll the old chariot along**  
**We’ll roll the old chariot along**  
**And we’ll all hang on behind**  

And a little mug of beer wouldn’t do me any harm  
Oh, a little mug of beer… *[x2]*  

And a plate of Irish stew…  

And a little slug of gin…  

And a little drop of wine…  

And a night upon the shore…  
No a night upon the shore…  
No a night upon a whore wouldn’t do me any harm  

And a drop of Nelson’s blood…  


# Drunken Sailor  

What shall we do with a drunken sailor** ***[3x]*** **  
**Ear-ly in the morning **  
** **  
**Way, hey, up she rises****_ _***[3x] *  
**Ear-ly in the morning **  
   
Put him in the long boat ‘til he’s sober   

Put him in the bilge and make him drink it   

Put him in a leaky boat and make him bail her   

Tie him to the scuppers with the hose pipe on him   

Shave his belly with a rusty razor   

Tie him to the topmast while she’s yardarm under   

Heave him by the leg in a runnin’ bowline   

Keel haul him ‘til he’s sober   


**Went to sea with a drunken sailor **  
**Six long months in a leaky whaler **  
**Put him in the hold and made him bail ‘er**  
**Ear-ly in the morning**  

# Eddystone Light   

My father was the keeper of the Eddystone light** **  
And he slept with a mermaid one fine night** **  
Out of this union there came three** **  
A porpoise and a porgy and the other was me!** **  
**Yo ho ho, the wind blows free, **   
**Oh for the life on the rolling sea***! *** **  
** **  
One night, as I was a-trimming the glim ** **  
Singing a verse from the evening hymn ** **  
I heard a voice cry out "Ahoy!" ** **  
And there was my mother, sitting on a buoy. ** **  

"Oh, what has become of my children three?" ** **  
My mother then inquired of me. ** **  
"One's on exhibit as a talking fish ** **  
The other was served in a chafing dish." ** **  

Then the phosphorus flashed in her seaweed hair. ** **  
I looked again, and my mother wasn't there ** **  
But her voice came angrily out of the night ** **  
"To Hell with the keeper of the Eddystone Light!"

# Excursion Around The Bay  
Johnny Burke  

Well it was on this Monday morning and the day be calm and fineA harbour grace excursion with the boys who had the timeAnd just before the sailor took the gangway from the pierI saw some fellow haul me wife aboard as a volunteer  
**Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife cry,Oh me, oh my, I think I'm gonna die!Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife say,"I wish I'd never taken this excursion around the bay"**We had three hundred souls on board, oh what a splendid sight,Matt Strong in regimentals, to make our spirits bright;With meself being in the double, with the funny things they'd say,And they'd choke themselves from laughing, when they see us in the bay.Now, me wife she got no better, she turned a sickly green,I gave her soap and candy, fat pork and gasoline;Castor-oil and sugar of candy, I rubbed hair-oil on her face,And they said she'd be a dandy, when she reaches Harbour Grace.My wife she got no better, my wife, my darling dear,The screeches from her throat, you could hear in Carbonear;I searched every place in Harbour Grace, searched every store and shop,To get her something for the cure, or take her to the hop.  
Oh, she died below the Brandies, as we were coming back,We buried her in the ocean, wrapped up in the Union Jack;And now I am a single man, in search of a pretty face,And the woman who says she'll have me, I'm off for Harbour Grace!  

# Farewell To Nova Scotia  

The sun was setting in the West  
The birds were singing on every tree  
All nature seemed inclined to rest  
But still there was no rest for me  

**So farewell to Nova Scotia, your sea-bound coast**  
**Let your mountains dark and drear-y be**  
**For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed**  
**Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?**  

I grieve to leave my native land  
I grieve to leave my comrades all  
And my parents whom I held so dear  
And the bonny bonny lassie that I do adore  

Well the drums do beat and the wars do alarm  
My captain calls, I must obey  
So farewell, farewell to Nova Scotia’s charms  
For it’s early in the morning I'll be far far away  

I have three brothers, they are at rest  
Their arms are folded on their breast  
But a poor simple sailor just like me  
Must be tossed and driven on the dark blue sea  

*Won’t you keep a watch on Nova Scotia’s shores for me*  

# Farewell To Tarwathie   
   
Farewell to Tarwathie, adieu, Mormond Hill,   
And the dear land of Crimmond, I bid ye farewell;   
I'm bound out for Greenland and ready to sail,   
In hopes to find riches in hunting the whale.   
   
Adieu to my comrades, for a while we must part,   
And likewise the dear lass, wha’ fair won my heart;   
The cold ice of Greenland, my love will not chill,   
And the longer our absence, more loving she'll feel.   
   
Our ship is well rigged and she's ready to sail,   
Our crew they are anxious to follow the whale;   
Where the icebergs do float and the stormy winds blow,   
Where the land and the ocean are covered with snow.   
   
Oh the cold coast of Greenland is barren and bare,   
No seed-time or harvest is ever known there;   
The birds here sing sweetly on mountain and dale,   
But there is na’ a birdie to sing to the whale.   
   
There is no habitation, for a man to live there,   
And the king of that country is the fierce Greenland bear;   
And there'll be no temptation, to tarry long there,   
With our ship bumper full we will homeward repair  

# Fathom The Bowl  

Come all ye bold heroes, give an ear to me song!  
We’ll sing in the praise of good brandy and rum  
It’s a clear crystal fountain near Ireland doth roll  
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.  

**I’ll fathom the bowl,**  
**I’ll fathom the bowl**  
**Give me the punch ladle;**  
**I’ll fathom the bowl**  

From France we do get brandy; from Jamaica comes rum;  
Sweet oranges and apples from Portugal come,  
But stout and strong cider are Ireland’s control  
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.  

Me wife she do disturb me when I’m lyin’ at my ease  
She does as she likes; she says as she please.  
Me wife, she’s the devil, she’s black as the coal.  
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.  

Me father he do lie in the depths of the sea  
No stone at his head, but what matters for he  
It’s a clear crystal fountain near Ireland doth roll  
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.  

Come all ye bold heroes, give an ear to me song!  
We’ll sing in the praise of good brandy and rum  
It’s a clear crystal fountain near Ireland doth roll  
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.  

# Fiddler’s Green  
John Conolly   

**Dress me up in me oilskins and jumper **  
**No more on the docks I’ll be seen **  
**Just tell me old shipmates I’m taking a trip, mates **  
**And I’ll see you someday on Fiddler’s Green **  
** **  
Oh, Fiddler’s Green is a place I’ve heard tell   
Where fishermen go if they don’t go to Hell   
Where the weather is fair and the dolphins do play   
And the cold coast of Greenland is far far away   
   
Where the sky’s always blue and there’s never a gale   
Where the fish jump on board with a swish of their tails   
Where you lie at your leisure, there’s no work to do   
And the skipper’s below making tea for the crew   
   
When you get back to dock and your long trip is through   
There’s pubs, and there’s clubs, and there’s lassies there, too   
The girls are all pretty and the beer is all free   
And there’s bottles of rum growing on every tree   
   
Well I don’t want a harp nor a halo, not me   
Just give me a breeze and a good rolling sea   
And I’ll play me old squeezebox as we sail along  
With the wind in the rigging to sing me this song   

# Fields Of Athenry  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young girl calling  
"Michael, they have taken you away  
For you stole Trevelyan’s corn, so the young might see the morn  
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay"  

**Low lie the fields of Athenry**  
**Where once we watched the small free birds fly**  
**Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing**  
**It’s so lonely ’round the fields of Athenry**  

By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling  
"Nothing matters, Mary, when you’re free  
Against the famine and the crown I rebelled, they ran me down  
Now you must raise our child with dignity"  

By a lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star falling  
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky  
And she’ll wait and hope and pray, for her love in Botany Bay  
It’s so lonely ’round the fields of Athenry  

# The Final Trawl  
Archie Fisher  
** **  
Now it's three long years since we made her pay  
**Haul away, me laddie-o**  
And the owners say that she's had her day  
**Sing haul away, me laddie-o**  

So it's heave away for the final trawl  
It's an easy pull, for the catch is small  

Now it’s stow your gear, lads, and batten down  
And I'll take the wheel, lads, and turn her round  

And we'll join "The Venture" and "The Morning Star"  
Riding high and empty towards the bar  
For I'd rather beach her on the skerry rock  
Than to see her torched in the breakers Docklands   

And when I die, you can stow me down  
In her rusty hold, where the breakers sound  

Then I'll make the haven of Fiddler's Green  
Where the grub is good and the bunks are clean  

For I've fished a lifetime, boy and man  
And the final trawl scarcely nets a cran  

So it's heave away for the final trawl  
It's an easy pull, for the catch is small  

# Finnegan’s Wake  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

Tim Finnegan lived in Walker Street  
A gentle Irishman, mighty odd  
He’d a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet  
And to rise in the world he carried a hod  
Tim had a sort of a tipplin’ way  
With the love of the liquor, poor Tim was born  
And to help him on with his work each day  
He’d a drop of the craythür every morn’  

**Whack fol the da, now, dance to your partner**  
**’Round the floor your trotters shake**  
**Wasn't it the truth I tell you**  
**Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake**  

One morning Tim was rather full  
His head felt heavy, which made him shake  
He fell from the ladder and he broke his skull  
And they carried him home, his corpse to wake  
They rolled him up in a nice clean sheet  
And laid him out upon the bed  
With a gallon of whiskey at his feet  
And a barrel of porter at his head  

His friends assembled at the wake  
And Mrs. Finnegan called for lunch  
First they brought in tea and cake  
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch  
Biddy O’Brien began to cry  
"Such a nice clean corpse did you ever see?  
Tim, mavourneen2, why did you die?"  
"Ah, hold your gob," said Paddy McGee  

Then Maggie O’Connor took up the job  
"O Biddy," says she, “you’re wrong I’m sure”  
Biddy gave her a belt in the gob  
And left her sprawling on the floor  
Then the war did soon engage  
’Twas woman-to-woman and man-to-man  
Shillelagh law was all the rage  
And a row and a ruction soon began  

Then Mickey Maloney raised his head  
When a gallon of whiskey flew at him  
It missed, and falling on the bed  
The liquor scattered over Tim!  
Tim revives, look how he rises  
Timothy rising from the bed  
"Whirl your whiskey ‘round like blazes,  
Thundering Christ, d’you think I’m dead?"  

# Fire Down Below  
From Tripple Nipple Jones  

I'm just a simple country lad to London just come down  
To tell you the scrapes and narrow escapes I had when last in town.  
 'Twas market day and I'd sold me hay  
And stood things to admire.  
When all at once a chap called out   
He'd mastermind the fire.  

**Fire fire fire, fire down below.**  
**Let's hope that we may never see a fire down below.**  

I turned around to ask a lass the cause of all this stir,  
And if she'd mind as to be so kind as to tell me where it where.  
Said she "Young man, yes that I can,   
Do all that you inquire,  
So come with me, and you shall see,   
I'll take you where there's fire."  

With that she linked her arm in mine and down the street she steered  
To some back slum she called her home but still no fire appeared.  
In a house we creeped, upstairs we peeped  
Three stories high and higher.  
In a room we stopped, all night we popped  
But I couldn't find the fire.  

In the morning when I wakened up, my lady bird had flown.  
Not only lass, but all my brass, my watch my clothes were gone.  
Bare laggin' in feet, I ran in the street  
Me shirt me sole attire.  
The women all laughed, the men they chaffed   
But I kept callin' FIRE!  

But some good chance, I made it home, half-dead with shame and fright,  
And all that saw and knew me well said, "Spoonie, served you right."  
But the worst wasn't past, it came at last,  
I thought I should expire.  
Say what you will I was very ill   
And the doctor said 'twas fire.  

So come all you good gentleman, well courting have not been  
Be advised by me, don't foolish be, by all I've done and seen.  
Don't miss your ways on market days  
Or stand things to admire,  
But avoid back slums and female chums  
And don't go catching fire.  

Fish in the Sea  
From Titan Triggerfish  

Come all you young sailormen, listen to me  
I'll sing you a song of the fish in the sea,  
and it's...  

**Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys**  
**When the wind blows we're all together, boys**  
**Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow**  
**Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.**  

Up jumps the eel with his slippery tail,  
Climbs up aloft and reefs the topsail,  
and it's...  

Then up jumps the shark with his nine rows of teeth  
Saying, 'You eat the dough boys, and I'll eat the beef!'  
and it's...  

Up jumps the lobster with his heavy claws,  
Bites the main boom right off by the jaws!   
and it's...  

Up jumps the halibut, lies flat on the deck  
He says, 'Mister Captain, don't step on my neck!'  
and it's...  

Up jumps the herring, the king of the sea,  
Saying, 'All other fishes, now you follow me!'  
and it's...  

Up jumps the codfish with his chuckle-head,  
He runs out up forward and throws out the lead!  
and it's...  

Up jumps the whale, the largest of all,  
'If you want any wind, well, I'll blow ye a squall!'  
and it's…  

# The Flowers Of Bermuda  
Stan Rogers   

**(S)he was the captain of the Nightingale **  
**Twenty-one days from Clyde in coal **  
**(S)he could smell the flowers of Bermuda in the gale **  
**When (s)he died on the North Rock shoal **  
   
Just five short hours from Bermuda   
In a fine October gale   
There came a cry, " Oh, there be breakers dead ahead   
From the collier Nightingale   
No sooner had the captain brought her round,   
Came a rending crash below   
Hard on her beam ends groaning, went the Nightingale   
And o’erside her mainmast goes   
   
"O captain are we all for drowning,"   
Came a cry from all the crew   
"The boats be smashed!  How are we all then to be saved?   
They are stove in through and through   
 O are ye brave and hardy colliermen   
Or are you blind and cannot see   
The captain's gig still lies before ye whole and sound   
And it shall carry all of we   
   
But when the crew was all assembled   
And the gig prepared for sea   
'Twas seen there were but eighteen places to be manned   
Nineteen mortal souls were we   
But cries the captain, *"Now do not delay *  
*Nor do you spare a thought for me *  
*My duty is to save you all now if I can *  
*See ye return quick as can be!"*  
   
Oh, there be flowers in Bermuda   
Beauty lies on every hand   
And there be laughter ease and drink for every man   
But there is no joy for me   
 For when we reached the wretched Nightingale   
What an awful sight was plain   
The captain, drowned, was tangled in the mizzen chains   
Smiling bravely beneath the sea  


# Foggy Dew  

From Tripple Nipple Jones  

As down the glen one Easter morn, to a city fair rode I   
There arm-ed lines of marching men, in squadrons passed me by   
No fife did hum, nor battle drum, did sound its dread tattoo,   
But the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out through the foggy dew   

Right proudly high over Dublin Town, they hung out the flag of war   
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky, than at Sulva (NOTE: Pronounced "Sool-vuh.") or Sud El Bar (NOTE:  “Sood-El-Bar”)   
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through   
While Britannia's Huns, with their long range guns, sailed in through the foggy dew   

Oh the night fell black, and the rifles' crack made perfidious Albion reel  
In the leaden rain, seven tongues of flame did shine o'er the lines of steel  
By each shining blade a prayer was said, that to Ireland her sons be true  
But when morning broke, still the war flag shook out its folds in the foggy dew  

'Twas Britannia bade our Wild Geese go, that small nations might be free   
But their lonely graves are by Sulva's waves, or the shore of the Great North Sea   
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Cathal Brugha (NOTE:  "Ca-ull Brew")   
Their names we will keep, where the fenians sleep, 'neath the shroud of the foggy dew  

But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell, rang mournfully and clear   
For those who died, that Eastertide, in the springing of the year   
And the world did gaze, in deep amaze, at those fearless men but few   
Who bore the fight, that freedom's light, might shine through the foggy dew   


# Friggin’ In The Riggin’  

**Friggin’ in the riggin’**  
**Friggin’ in the riggin’**  
**Friggin’ in the riggin’**  
**There’s fuck all else to do.**  

Twas on the good ship Venus,  
By God you should have seen us-  
The figurehead was a whore in bed  
And the mast a throbbing penis.  

The Captain of that lugger  
Was known as a filthy bugger,  
Declared unfit to shovel shit  
From one pile to another.  

The Captain’s daughter Charlotte  
By god she was a harlot  
At night her thighs were lily white  
By morning they were scarlet.  

The Captain’s other daughter,  
Was swimming in the water,  
When peals of squeals revealed that eels  
Discovered her sexual quarter  

The bosun’s name was Andy,  
By god he was a dandy  
We crushed his cock upon a rock  
For cumming in the brandy.    

The cook his name was Freeman,  
And he was a dirty demon,  
And he fed the crew on menstrual stew  
And hymens fried in semen  

And when we reached our station  
Through skillful navigation  
Our ship was sunk in a wave of spunk  
From too much masturbation.  






# General Taylor  
   
General Taylor gained the day   
**Walk him along, John carry him along*** *  
General Taylor gained the day   
**Carry him to his burying ground*** *  
* *  
**To me way, hey, you stormy **  
**Walk him along, John carry him along **  
**To me way, hey, you stormy **  
**Carry him to his burying ground **  
   
We’ll dig his grave with a silver spade…   
His shroud of the finest silk will be made…   
   
We’ll lower him down on a golden chain   
On every inch we’ll carve his name   
   
General Taylor he’s all the go   
He's gone where the stormy winds won’t blow   
   
General Taylor he’s dead and he's gone   
General Taylor he’s long dead and gone  

# Get Up Jack, John Sit Down   

Well ships may come and ships may go, as long as the seas do roll   
And a sailor lad, just like his dad, he loves his rum and bowl   
Now a lass ashore he do adore, a woman who’s plump and round   
But when your money’s all gone it’s the same old song:   

**Get up Jack, John sit down! **  
**Come along, come along me jolly brave boys **  
**There’s plenty more grog in the jar **  
**We’ll plow the briny ocean with a jolly roving tar **  

When Jack’s ashore he’ll make his way to some old boarding house   
He’s welcomed in with rum and gin, likewise with fork and scouse   
And he’ll spend and he’ll spend and never offend, ’til he lies drunk on the ground…   

When Jack is old and weather-beat, too old to sail about   
They’ll let him stop at some grog shop ’til eight bells calls him out   
Then he’ll raise his glass high, and loudly he’ll cry "Thank God I’m homeward bound…"  

# The Golden Vanity  

There was a lofty ship and they put her out to sea  
And the name of the ship was the Golden Vanity  
And they sailed her on **the lowland lowland low**  
**And they sailed her on the lowland sea**  

And she had not been sailing but two weeks or three  
When she was overtaken by a Turkish revelry  
As she sailed along the lowland lowland low...  

Then boldly up spoke our little cabin boy  
Saying, What would you give me if the galley I destroy  
If I sink them in the lowland lowland low  

To the man that them destroys, our captain then replied  
Five thousand pounds and my daughter for his bride  
If he'll sink them in the lowland lowland low  

The boy he made ready and overboard went he  
And he swam to the side of the Turkish enemy  
As she lay along the lowlands lowlands low  

And he had a brace and auger made for the use  
And he bored nine holes in her hull all at once  
As she lay along the lowland lowland low  

And some were playing poker and some were playing dice  
And some were in their hammocks and the sea as cold as ice  
And the water rushed in and it dazzled to their eyes  

He swam back to his ship and he beat upon the side  
Crying, Shipmates take me up for I'm wearied with the tide  
And I'm weary of the lowlands lowlands low  

Well, I'll not pick you up, the captain then replied  
I'll shoot you, I'll drown you, I'll sink you in the tide  
I will sink you in the lowland lowland low  

If it was not for the love that I bear for your men  
I'd do unto you as I did unto them  
I would sink you in the lowland lowland low  

And the boy bowed his head and down sank he  
And he said farewell to the Golden Vanity  
As she lay along the lowland lowland low  

# Greenland Whale Fisheries  
** **  
They took us jolly sailor lads  
A-fishing for the whale  
In the year of our lord eighteen hundred and six  
Bound for Greenland we set sail  

The lookout stood on the crosstrees high  
With a spyglass in his hand  
There's a whale, there's a whale, there's a whalefish, he cried  
And she blows at every span  

The Captain stood on the quarter deck  
And a sod of a man was he  
Overhaul, overhaul, let your davit tackles fall  
And we'll launch them boats to sea  

We stuck that whale and the line played out  
But she gave a flurry with her tail  
And the boat capsized, we lost seven of our men  
And we never caught that whale  

Now the losing of seven fine seamen  
Oh it grieved our captain sore  
But the losing of that bloody sperm whale  
Oh it grieved him ten times more  

Now Greenland is a horrid place  
Where us fisher-lads have to go  
Where the rose and the lily never bloom in Spring  
And there's only ice and snow  

# The Grey Funnel Line   
Ciril Tawney  

Don’t mind the rain, nor the rolling sea   
The weary night never worries me   
But the hardest time in a sailor’s day   
Is to watch the sun as it dies away   
**It’s one more day on the Grey Funnel Line **  
** **  
The finest ship that sailed the sea   
Is still a prison for the likes of me   
But give me wings like Noah’s dove   
I’d fly up harbour to the girl I love…   
   
Every time I gaze behind the screws   
Makes me long for old Peter’s shoes   
I’d walk on  down that silver lane   
And take my love in my arms again   
   
O Lord, if dreams were only real   
I’d have my hands on that wooden wheel   
And with all my heart I’d turn her ’round   
And tell the crew that we’re homeward bound   
   
I’ll pass the time like some machine   
Until the blue water turns to green   
Then I’ll dance on down that walk ashore   
And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more   

# Haul Away Joe  
The first song ever sung by the crew in a show   
** **  
When I was a little boy my mother always told me   
**’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe **  
That if I did not fuck the girls my prick would grow all moldy   
**’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe **  
** **  
Once in my life I married a wife but she was fat and lazy…   
Then I met an Irish girl, she damn near drove me crazy…   
   
**’Way, haul away, we’re bound for better weather **  
**’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe**   
   
Once I was in Ireland, a-digging turf and taters   
But now I’m on a Limey (pirate) ship, a-hauling on the braces   
   
St. Patrick drove away the snakes, then drank up all the whiskey   
This made him sing and dance a jig, he felt so fine and frisky   
   
**’Way, haul away, we’re bound for better weather **  
**’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe**   
   
You call yourself a second mate but you can’t tie a bowline   
You cannot even stand up straight when the ship is a-rolling   
   
The cook is in the galley making duff so handy   
The captain’s in his cabin drinking wine and brandy   
   
**’Way, haul away, the good ship is a-rolling **  
**’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe**  

# Haul On The Bowline  

Haul on the bowline, my Kitty comes from Liverpool  
**Haul on the bowline, the bowline, haul!**  

Haul on the bowline, Liverpool’s a fine town…  

Haul on the bowline, Kitty’s on the game againn  

Haul on the bowline, the good ship is a-rolling  

Haul on the bowline, the old man is a-growling  

Haul on the bowline, we’ll either break or bend her  

Haul on the bowline, we’re man enough to mend her  

Haul on the bowline, and bust the chafing leather  

Haul on the bowline, we’ll hang for finer weather  

Haul on the bowline, Hall is my sister’s name  


# Here’s A Health to the Company  
Transcribed by Humpy Gussy from the Chieftains  
   
Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme  
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine  
Come lift up your voices all grief to refrain  
For we may or might never all meet here again  
   
**So here’s a health to the company and one to my lass**  
**Let’s drink and be merry all out of one glass**  
**Let’s drink and be merry, all grief to refrain**  
**For we may or might never all meet here again**  

Here’s a health to the wee lass that I love so well  
For style and for beauty there’s none can excel  
There’s a smile on her countenance as she sits on my knee  
There is no man in this wide world as happy as me  
   
Our ship lies at anchor, she is ready to dock  
I wish her safe landing without any shock  
And if ever I should meet you by land or by sea  
I will always remember your kindness to me

# Hills Of Connemara  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

**Gather up the pots and the old tin cans**  
**The mash, the corn, the barley and the bran,**  
**Run like the devil from the excise man**  
**Keep the smoke from rising, Barney.**  

Keep your eyes well peeled today,  
The excise men are on their way,  
Searching for the mountain tay  
In the hills of Connemara.  

Swinging to the left, swinging to the right  
The excise men will dance all night  
Drinkin’ up the tay till the broad daylight  
In the hills of Connemara  

A gallon for the butcher and a quart for John  
And a bottle for poor old Father Tom  
To help the poor old dear along  
In the hills of Connemara  

Stand your ground and don’t you fall  
The excise men are at the wall  
Jesus Christ! They’re drinkin’ it all!  
In the hills of Connemara  

# Hoist The Colours   
   
The king and his men stole the queen from her bed   
And bound her in her bones   
The seas be ours and by the powers   
Where we will we'll roam   
   
**Yo, ho, all hands **  
**Hoist the colours high **  
**Heave ho, thieves and beggars **  
**Never shall we die **  
   
Some men have died and some are alive   
And others sail on the sea   
With the keys to the cage and the Devil to pay   
We lay to Fiddler's Green   
   
**Yo, ho, haul together… **  
   
The bell has been raised from its watery grave   
Do you hear its sepulchral tone?   
We’re a call to all, pay heed the squall   
And turn your sails toward home!   

# The Irish Rover   
** **  
In the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and six   
We set sail from the Coal Quay of Cork   
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks   
For the grand City Hall in New York   
We’d an elegant craft, it was rigged ’fore and aft   
And how the trade winds drove her   
She had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts   
And they called her the Irish Rover   
   
There was Barney Magee from the banks of the Lee   
There was Hogan from County Tyrone   
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work   
And a chap from Westmeath named Malone   
There was Slugger O’Toole, who was drunk as a rule   
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover   
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann   
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover    
   
There was awl Mickey Coote, who played hard on his flute   
When the ladies lined up for his set   
He was tooting with skill for each sparkling quadrille   
Though the dancers were fluttered and bet   
With his sparse, witty talk he was cock of the walk   
As he rolled the dames under and over   
They all knew at a glance when he took off his pants  
That he sailed in the Irish Rover   
   
We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags   
We had two million barrels of bone   
We had three million bales of old nanny goats’ tails   
We had four million barrels of stone   
We had five million hogs and six million dogs   
And seven million barrels of porter   
We had eight million sides of old blind horses’ hides   
In the hold of the Irish Rover   
   
We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out   
And our ship lost her way in a fog   
And a whale of a crew was reduced down to two   
’Twas myself and the captain’s old dog   
Then the ship struck a rock, oh, Lord what a shock   
And nearly tumbled over   
She turned nine times around, then the poor old dog was drowned   
I’m the last of the Irish Rover  
# I’ll Tell Me Ma  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

**I’ll tell me ma when I go home**  
**The boys won’t leave the girls alone**  
**They pulled my hair, they stole my comb**  
**But that’s alright ’til I go home**  
**She is handsome, she is pretty**  
**She’s the belle of Belfast city**  
**She’s a-courting, one two three**  
**Please won’t you tell me who is she**  

Albert Mooney says he loves her  
All the boys are fighting for her  
Knocking on the door, ringing on the bell  
Singing, "oh, my true love, are you well?"  
Out she comes now, white as snow  
Rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes  
Old Jenny Murphy says she’ll die  
If she don’t get the fellow with the roving eye  

Oh the wind and the rain and the hail blow high  
And the snow comes a tumbling from the sky  
She’s as nice as apple pie  
And she’ll get her own lad by-and-by  
When she gets a lad of her own  
She won’t tell her ma when she comes home  
Let them all come as they will  
For it’s Albert Mooney she loves still  

# I’se The B’y   
   
I’s the b’y that builds the boat   
And I’s the b’y that sails her   
I’s the b’y that catches the fish   
And takes ’em home to ’Lizer   
   
**Hip your partner, Sally Tibbo **  
**Hip your partner, Sally Brown **  
**Fogo, Twillingate, Morton’s Harbour **  
**All around the circle **  
   
Sods and rinds to cover your flake   
Cake and tea for supper   
Codfish in the spring o’ the year   
Fried in maggoty butter   
   
I don’t want your maggoty fish   
That’s no good for winter   
I could buy as good as that   
Down in Bonavista   
   
I took ’Lizer to a dance   
And faith, but she could travel   
And every step that she did take   
Was up to her knees in gravel   
   
Susan White, she’s out of sight   
Her petticoat wants a border   
Old Sam Oliver in the dark   
He kissed her in the corner

There’s rotten meat and weev’ly bread

She would not steer and she would not stay   
She shipped the water both night and day   
   
We’re all Liverpool born and bred   
Strong in the arm but thick in the head

If you growl too loud your head they’ll bust   
   
Around Cape Horn our ship must go   
Around Cape Horn through the ice and snow   
   
My dear old mum she wrote to me   
Oh son, my son come home from sea   
   
It’s one more pull and that will do   
And we’re the bullies to pull her through  

Oh you don’t need a condom when you’re upper class  
‘Cause you can’t make a baby in the middle class’ ass

Oh you don’t need a condom when you’re with Whiskey  
‘Cause Whiskey just had a vasectomy

# Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

While on the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo (x2)  
While on the road to sweet Athy, a stick in me hand and a drop in me eye  
A doleful damsel I heard cry:  
"Johnny I hardly knew ye"

Where are the eyes that looked so mild when my heart ye first beguiled  
Why did ye skedaddle from me and the child

Indeed yer dancing days are done  
Johnny I hardly knew ye  

Ye haven’t an arm, ye haven’t a leg, hurroo, hurroo (x2)  
Ye haven’t an arm, ye haven’t a leg, ye’re an eyeless, boneless chickenless egg  
Ye’ll have to be put with a bowl to beg  
Johnny I hardly knew ye

So low in flesh, so high in bone

They’re rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo (x2)  
They’re rolling out the guns again, but they’ll never take our sons again  
No they’ll never take our sons again  
Johnny I’m swearin’ to ye  

# Johnny Jump Up  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

I’ll tell you a story that happened to me  
One day as I went down to Yule-by-the-Sea  
The sun it was bright and the day it was warm  
Says I, "a quiet pint wouldn’t do me no harm"  
I went in to the barman, I said "Give me a stout."  
Said the barman "I’m sorry, all the beer ‘tis sold out  
Try whiskey, try sherry, ten years in the wood"  
Says I, "I’ll try cider, I’ve heard that it’s good"  

**Oh never, oh never, oh never again**  
**If I live to a hundred or a hundred and ten**  
**I fell to the ground and I couldn’t get up**  
**After drinking a pint of that Johnny Jump Up**  

After leaving the pub I went back to the yard  
When I bumped into Brolfy, the big civic guard  
"Come here to me, boy, don’t you know I’m the law"  
I upped with my fist and I shattered his jaw  
He fell to the ground with his knees doubled up  
But it wasn’t I’d hit him, ‘twas the Johnny Jump Up  
And the next man I met out in Yule-by-the-Sea  
Was an old man on crutches, and he said to me  
"I fear for me life I’ll be hit by a car  
Won’t you help me across to the railwaymans’ bar?"  
After a drinking a sip of that cider so sweet  
He threw down his crutches and danced in the street  

I went down the Lee Road, a friend for to see  
They call it the madhouse in Cork-by-the-Lee  
And when I got up there, the truth I should tell  
They had the poor bugger locked up in his cell  
Said the guard testing him, "say these words if you can:  
‘Around the ragged rock, the ragged rascal ran’"  
"Tell them I’m not crazy, tell them I’m not mad  
It was only a drop of the creature I had"  

A man died in the Union by the name of McNabb  
They washed him and laid him outside on a slab  
And after the coroner his measurements did take  
His wife took him home for a bloody fine wake  
‘Twas about twelve o’clock and the beer it was high  
The corpse he sat up, and he says with a sigh  
"I can’t get to Heaven, they won’t let me up  
’Til I bring them a pint of that Johnny Jump Up"  

# Join the British Army  
From Tripple Nipple Jones and Smidge and Compass  

When I was young, I used to be, as fine a man as ever you'd see   
The Prince of Wales, he said to me, "Come join the British army"   

**Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, they're looking for monkeys up in the zoo **  
**Says one, if I’d a face like you, I’d join the British army**  

Sarah Comden baked a cake, it was all for poor Slattery's sake   
So I threw meself into the lake, pretending I was barmy  

**Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, I’ve made me mind up what to do**  
**So I’ll work my ticket home to you, and fuck the British army**  

Seargent Healy went away, and his wife got in the family way  
And the only words that she could say were "Blame the British army"  

**Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, me curse upon the labour crew**  
**That took your darling boy from you to join the British army**  

Corporal Sheen was a terrible lout, just give him a couple of pints of stout   
And he’d beat the enemy with his mouth, and save the British Army  

**Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, I’ve made me mind up what to do**  
**So I’ll work my ticket home to you, and fuck the British army**  
   
When I was young, I used to be, as fine a man as ever you'd see   
The Prince of Wales, I says to he, "The hell with the British army!"  

**Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, I’ve made me mind up what to do**  
**So I’ll work my ticket home to you, and fuck the British army!**  


# London Julie  
From Boxfoot  

Juliana, Juliana where do you go?  
**Ah ha, me London Julie**  
Juliana, Juliana where do you go?  
**Ah ha, me London Julie**  

Up aloft, up aloft this spar must go  
Up aloft, up aloft from down below  

Around Cape Horn there's ice and snow  
But around Cape Horn we've got to go  

The mate is a-bawlin' down below  
So heave away, let's stamp and go  




# The Last Shanty   
Tom Lewis (additional verse by ARRR!!!)  
** **  
My father often told me when I was just a lad   
A sailor’s life is very hard, the food is always bad   
But now I’ve joined the Navy, I’m on board a man-o’-war   
And now I find a sailor ain’t a sailor anymore   
   
**Don’t haul on the rope, don’t climb up the mast **  
**If you see a sailing ship it might be your last **  
**Just get your civvies ready for another run ashore **  
**A sailor ain’t a sailor ain’t a sailor anymore **  
** **  
The killick of our mess he says we’ve had it soft   
It wasn’t like this in his day when he was up aloft   
We like our bunks and sleeping bags, but what’s a hammock for?   
Swinging from the deckhead or lying on the floor?   
   
They gave us an engine that first went up and down   
Then with more technology the engine went around   
We’re good with steam and diesel, but what’s a mainyard for?   
A stoker ain’t a stoker with a shovel anymore   
   
They gave us an Aldis Lamp so we can do it right   
They gave us a radio, we signal day and night   
We know our codes and ciphers, but what’s a "sema" for?   
A bunting-tosser doesn’t toss the bunting anymore   
   
They gave us a radar set to pierce the fog and gloom   
Now the lookout’s sitting in a tiny darkened room   
Loran does navigation, the sonar says how deep   
The Jimmy’s three sheets to the wind, the skipper’s fast asleep   
   
They gave us a songbook so we’d know what to do   
They gave us some MP3s, we listened to ’em to   
We know our scales and harmonies, but what’s a cutlass for?   
A pirate ain’t a pirate ain’t a pirate anymore   
   
Two cans of beer a day, that’s your bleeding lot   
But now we gets an extra one because they stopped the Tot   
So, we’ll put on our civvy-clothes and find a pub ashore   
A sailor’s still a sailor, just like he was before  

# Leave Her, Johnny, Leave Her  

Oh the times are hard and the wages low  
**Leave her, Johnny, leave her**  
But now once more ashore we’ll go  
**And it’s time for us to leave her**  

**Leave her, Johnny, leave her**  
**Oh leave her, Johnny, leave her**  
**For the voyage is done and the winds don’t blow**  
**And it’s time for us to leave her**  

The winds were foul and the work was hard....  
From the Liverpool dock to the London yard....  

There was rotten meat and weev’ly bread  
You’d eat it or you’d starve to death  

I hate to sail on this rotten tub  
No grog allowed and rotten grub  

The skipper was bad but the mate was worse  
He’d blow you down with a spike and a curse  

Oh the winds were hard and the water high  
She shipped it green and none went by  

The sails are furled and the anchor is stowed  
And no more around Cape Horn we’ll go  

I thought I heard the old man say  
You can go ashore and spend your pay  

The rats have left, and we the crew  
It’s time, by Christ, that we did, too  

We’ll make her fast and stow our gear  
The gals are a-waiting on the pier  

Oh if ye can leave her like a man  
Then leave her, Johnny, while ye can  

# The Leaving Of Liverpool   

Farewell to Prince’s landing stage   
Mersey River, fare thee well   
I am bound for Californ-i-ay  
A place I know right well   
   
**So fare thee well my own true love **  
**And when I return, united we will be **  
**It’s not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me **  
**But my darling when I think of thee**   
   
I am bound for Californ-i-ay   
By the way of the stormy Cape Horn   
And I’ll write to you a letter, love   
When I am homeward bound   
   
I have signed on a Yankee clipper ship   
Davy Crockett is her name   
And Burgess is the captain of her   
And they say she is a floating shame   
   
I have sailed with Burgess once before   
And I think I know him right well   
If a man is a sailor, he can get along   
But if not than he’s surely in hell   
   
Oh, the fog is on the harbor love   
And I wish I could remain   
But I know it will be some long time   
Before I see you again    

# Lukey’s Boat  

Lukey’s boat is painted green  
**Ha, me boys**  
Lukey’s boat is painted green; it’s the prettiest boat that you’ve ever seen  
**Aha, me boys, a riddle-i-day**  
**Aha, me boys, a riddle-i-day**  

Lukey’s boat’s got a fine fore cutty…  
Lukey’s boat’s got a fine fore cutty, and every seam is chinked with putty  

I says, "Lukey, the blinds are down"…  
I says, "Lukey, the blinds are down; me wife is dead and she’s underground"  

I says, "Lukey, I don’t care"…  
I says, "Lukey, I don’t care; I’ll get me another in the spring o’ the year"  

Lukey’s rolling out his grub…  
Lukey’s rolling out his grub – one split pea in a ten pound tub  

Lukey’s boat’s got high-topped sails…  
Lukey’s boat’s got high-topped sails and she was planched with copper nails  

Lukey’s boat is painted green…  
Lukey’s boat is painted green; it’s the prettiest boat that you’ve ever seen  

# Maggie May  

Come all ye sailors bold, and when me tale is told  
I know ye all will sadly pity me  
For I was a god-damn fool in the port o’ Liverpool  
On the voyage when I first paid off from sea  

**Oh Maggie Maggie May, they have taken you away**  
**For to slave upon Van Dieman’s cruel shore**  
**Oh, you robbed many a sailor, and many a drunken whaler**  
**But you’ll never cruise down Paradise Street no more!**  

I paid off at the Home, after a voyage from Sierra Leone  
Two pound ten a month had been my pay;  
As I jingled in me tin, I was sadly taken in  
By a lady of the name of Maggie May  

When I steered into her, I hadn’t got a care  
I was cruisin’ up and down old Canning Place;  
She was in a gown so fine, like a frigate of the line,  
And bein’ a sailorman, I gave her chase  

**Chorus**  

She gave me a saucy nod, and like a farmer’s clod  
I let her take me line abreast in tow  
An’ under all plain sail, we ran before the gale  
An’ to the Crow’s Nest Tavern we did go  

Next mornin’ when I woke, I found that I was broke  
I hadn’t got a penny to me name  
So I had to pop me suit, me John Ls and me Boots  
Down in the Kelly Pawn Shop Number Nine  

**Oh you theivin’ Maggie May, ye robbed me of my pay**  
**When I slept with you that night ashore**  
**Oh, guilty the jury found her, for robbin’ a homeward-bounder**  
**And she’ll never roll down Paradise Street no more**  

She was chained and sent away from Liverpool one day;  
The lads they cheered as she sailed down the Bay  
And every sailor lad, he only was too glad  
They’d sent the old whore out to Botany Bay!  

# The Mariner's Revenge Song   
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>We are two mariners
Our ship's sole survivors 
In this belly of a whale. 
Its ribs are ceiling beams 
Its guts are carpeting
I guess we have some time to kill.  

You may not remember me 
I was a child of three 
And you, a lad of eighteen. 
But I remember you 
And I will relate to you 
How our histories interweave:

At the time you were  arake and a roustabout 
Spending all your money  on the whores and hounds (oh, oh)

You had a charming air 
All cheap and debonair 
My widowed mother found so sweet, 
And so she took you in 
Her sheets still warm with him 
Now filled with filth and foul disease. 

As time wore on you proved  a debt-ridden drunken mess 
Leaving my mother  a poor consumptive wretch  (oh, oh)

And then you disappeared 
Your gambling arrears 
The only thing you left behind. 
And then the magistrate 
Reclaimed our small estate
And my poor mother lost her mind. 

Then, one day in spring  my dear sweet mother died 
But, before she did  I took her hand as she, dying, cried:  (oh, oh)

"Find him, Bind him 
Tie him to a pole and break 
His fingers to splinters 
Drag him to a hole until he
Wakes up naked 
Clawing at the ceiling
Of his grave!"</td>
    <td>It took me fifteen years
To swallow all my tears 
Among the urchins in the street 
Until a priory 
Took pity and hired me 
To keep their vestry nice and neat. 

But, never once in the employ  of these holy men 
Did I ever, once turn my mind from the thought of revenge (oh, oh)

One night I overheard 
The prior exchanging words 
With a penitent whaler from the sea: 
The captain of his ship 
Who matched you toe to tip
Was known for wanton cruelty. 

The following day  I shipped to sea  with a privateer 
And in the whistle  of the wind  I could almost hear (oh, oh)

Chorus

"There is one thing I must say to you 
As you sail across the sea 
Always, your mother will watch over you 
As you avenge this wicked deed" 

And then, that fateful night 
We had you in our sight 
After twenty months at sea 
Your starboard flank abeam 
I was getting my muskets clean 
When came this rumbling from beneath 

The ocean shook , the sky went black  and the captain quailed 
And before us grew  the angry jaws  of a giant whale   (oh..) 

I don't know how I survived 
The crew all was chewed alive 
I must have slipped between his teeth 
But, oh, what providence 
What divine intelligence 
That you should survive 
As well as me

 It gives my heart great joy  to see your eyes fill with fear
So lean in close  and I will whisper he last words you'll hear  (oh, oh)</td>

# The Mary Ellen Carter  

She went down last October in a pouring driving rain.   
The skipper, he'd been drinking and the Mate, he felt no pain.   
Too close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow,   
And the Mary Ellen Carter settled low.   
There was just us five aboard her when she finally was awash.   
We'd worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost.   
And the groan she gave as she went down, it caused us to proclaim   
That the Mary Ellen Carter would rise again.   
   
Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend.   
She gave twenty years of service, boys, but met her sorry end.   
But insurance paid the loss to us, so let her rest below.   
Then they laughed at us and said we had to go.   
Well we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock,   
For she's worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock.   
And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain   
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again.   
   
**Rise again, rise again, that her name not be lost **  
**To the knowledge of men**  
**Those who loved her best and were with her ‘til the end**  
**Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again**  
   
All spring, now, we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend.   
Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends.   
Thank God it's only sixty feet and the currents here are slow,   
Or I'd never have the strength to go below.   
Well we've patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down.   
Put cables to her, 'fore and aft, and girded her around.   
Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain.   
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again.   
   
For we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale.   
She'd saved our lives so many times, living through the gales,   
And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave—   
They won't be laughing in another day. . .   
And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow,   
With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go,   
Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain,   
And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again.   
   
**Rise again, rise again — though your heart it be broken and life about to end **  
**No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend; **  
**Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again. [x2]**  
# Mary Had A Little Lamb  

Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb  
Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow  

**Hurrah for Mary, hurrah for the lamb**  
**Hurrah for the Fenian boys who did not give a damn**  
**And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go**  
**Shouting the battle cry of freedom**  

Mary had a little lamb, her father shot it dead  
Now Mary takes her lamb to school between two slabs of bread  

Mary had a little lamb, it ran into a pylon  
Ten thousand volts went up its ass and turned its wool to nylon  

Mary had a little sheep, she took that sheep with her to sleep,  
The sheep turned out to be a ram, now Mary has a little lamb!  

# Mary Mac  
From Tripple Nipple Jones  

**Mary Mac's mother's making Mary Mac marry me,**  
**My mother's making me marry Mary Mac**  
**I'm gonna marry Mary so that Mary will take care ****o****' me,**  
**Well I’ll be feeling merry when I marry Mary Mac**  
**Do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do**  
\  
This little girl, her name is Mary Mac,  
Make no mistake she's the girl I’m gonna track,  
A lot of other fella's want to get her on her back,  
But I'm thinkin' that they'll have to get up early  

Now this wee lass, she’s got a lot of class,  
Got a lot of cash, she thinks I'm a gas,  
I'd be a silly ass, to let the matter pass,  
Her father thinks she suits me very fairly  

Now Mary and her mother gang an awful lot together,  
In fact you hardly ever see the one without the other,  
And people wonder whether it is Mary or her mother,  
Or both of them together that I'm courtin'  

Now the weddin' day 's on Wednesday, and everything's arranged,  
Her name will soon be changed to mine, unless her mind is changed,  
I'm making the arrangements, it’s making me deranged,  
For marriage is an awful undertaking  

It's sure to be a grand affair and grander than a fair   
There's going to be a coach and pair for every couple there   
We'll dine upon the finest fare I'm sure to get my share   
If I don't we'll all be very much mistaken  

This little girl, her name is Mary Mac,  
Make no mistake she's the girl I’m gonna track,  
A lot of other fella's want to get her on her back,  
But I'm thinkin' that they'll have to get up early  

# Mary’s Wedding  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

**Step we gaily on we go**  
**Heel for heel and toe for toe**  
**Arm and arm and rolling go**  
**All for Mary’s wedding**  

Over hill ways up and down  
Myrtle green and bracken brown  
Past the sheeling, through the town  
All for sake of Mary  

Red her cheeks as rowans are  
Bright her eye as any star  
Fairest of them all by far  
Is my darling Mary  

Plenty herring, plenty meal  
Plenty peat to fill her creel  
Plenty bonny bairns as well  
That’s the toast for Mary  

# The Mermaid  
Traditional. Additional verses by ARRR!!!   
** **  
’Twas a Friday morn when we set sail and we were not far from the land   
When our captain, (s)he spied, a mer-i-maid so fair with a comb and a spyglass in her hand   
   
**Oh the ocean waves do roll **  
**And the stormy winds do blow **  
**Aye, and we poor sailors are skipping at the top **  
**And the landlubbers lie down, below, below, below **  
**And the landlubbers lie down below **  
   
Well up spoke the captain of our gallant ship, and a fine spoken (wo)man was (s)he   
"This fishy mermaid has warned me of our doom. We shall sink to the bottom of the sea"   
   
Well up-spoke the mate of our gallant ship, and a dashing young (wo)man was she   
(S)he says "I have a wife, in Brooklyn by the sea, and to-night a widow she will be"   
   
Well up-spoke the bo’sun of our gallant ship and the spawn of the devil was-(s)he   
(S)he-says "Man the capstan round boys, haul on the lines. You’ll work to the bottom of the sea"   
   
Well up-spoke the cook of our gallant ship, and a greasy old butcher was (s)he   
(S)he-says "I care much more for my pots and my pans than I do for the bottom of the sea"   
   
Well up-spoke the cabin boy of our gallant ship, and a wretched liddle cabin boy was (s)he   
(S)he says "I left my fam’ly when I ran-away to sea, and to-night will they all grieve for me"   
   
Well up-spoke the grog-master of our gallant ship, and an old dirty boozer was (s)he

Well up spoke the chaplain of our gallant ship, and a pale wizened codger was (s)he   
(S)he-says "You’ve-had your chance now, it’s too late to repent. Laughing at you-all from Heaven I will be"   
   
Well up spoke the booty-master of our gallant ship, and a damn sly capital-ist was (s)he   
(S)he-says "Your deaths shall never settle in my books. In the next life you’re still in debt to me"   
   
Well up spoke a sailor of our gallant ship, and secretly a maiden was (s)he

Well one time ’round spun our gallant ship, and two times ’round went she   
Then three times ’round spun our gallant ship and she sank to the bottom of the sea

**Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys, **  
**Heave her head ‘round into the weather **  
**Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys, **  
**Sailing homeward to Mingulay **  
   
What care we how white the minch is   
What care we for the wind and weather   
For we know that every inch is   
Sailing closer to Mingulay   
   
Wives are waiting at the pierhead   
Looking seaward into the weather   
Heave her ‘round, boys, and we’ll anchor   
E’er the sun sets on Mingulay   
   
Far beyond the straits of Cooley,   
We can see our own land of heather,   
And you know, boys, candles glow, boys   
Lighting the windows of Mingulay   
   
*Ships return now, heavy laden *  
*Mothers holdin’ their bairns a-cryin’ *  
*We’ll return though, when the sun sets, *  
*We’ll return then to Mingulay*  

# The Minstrel Boy  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

The minstrel boy to war is gone  
In the ranks of death you will find him  
His father’s sword he hath girded on  
And his wild harp slung behind him  
"Land of Song!" cried the warrior bard  
"Tho’ every man betray thee  
One sword, at least, thy ranks shall guard  
One faithful harp shall praise thee!"  

The Minstrel fell, but the foeman’s steel  
Could not bring that proud soul under  
The harp he loved ne’er spoke again  
For he tore its chords asunder  
And said, "No chains shall sully thee  
Thou soul of love and bravery!  
Thy songs were made for the pure and free  
They shall never sound in slavery!"  
# Molasses   
Tom Rowe   
** **  
Oh, the African man cuts the sugar cane   
**Oh, molasses **  
He works in the sun and he works in the rain   
**Oh, molasses rum **  
Then he loads it up on a wooden ship and he sends it off on a northern trip   
**Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum **  
** **  
**Oh, molasses **  
**Old New England tea **  
**It killed my grandpa, killed my pa **  
**And it sure as Hell is killing me **  
**Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum **  
** **  
When they fought the war for the colonies…   
They fought it over New England tea…   
When Old King George put a tax on it the colonies nearly took a fit…   
   
In the time of the 1917 war   
Molasses sitting on the Boston shore   
When they pumped it in it was twelve degrees, a long cold night in a Boston freeze   
In the morning it was 42   
Molasses vat split clean in two   
Two million gallons covered the bay, 26 people drowned in the flood that day   
   
My grandpa he died cutting cane   
My pa went down in the great brown rain   
But I won’t go in a pool of blood; no I won’t drown in a black-strap flood   
Still, I’ll go down to molasses, oh molasses rum   

# Morning Glory   
** **  
**One for the ****_Morning Glory_**** **  
**Two for the sweet brown brew **  
**Three for the man who’ll stand his round **  
**And four for the love of you, me girls **  
**Four for the love of you **  
   
At the end of the day I like a couple drinks when I raise up my voice and sing   
An hour or two with the fine brown brew and I’m ready for anything   
At the Cross Keys Inn there were sisters four, the landlord’s daughters fair   
And every night when they turned out the light I would chase them up the stairs   
   
I got the call from foreign shores to go and fight the foe   
And I thought no more of the sisters four though they cried to see me go   
I sailed away on a ship, the *Morning Glory* was her name   
We’d all fall down when the rum went round, then get up and drink again   
   
I bore once more to my native shore, farewell to the raging main   
The Cross Keys Inn, it was beckoning, with the rum to ease my pain   
But there on the shore were the sisters four with a bundle upon each knee   
There were three little girls and a bastard boy and they all looked just like me  

# Morning Shanty   
** **  
Won't you come down to the shore  
**Watching**  
I will sail away once more  
**In the morning**  

We have sung through half the night  
**Watching**  
For the coming of the light  
**In the morning**  

For the friends who now have gone  
**Watching**  
For the friends returning home  
**In the morning**  

But the clock upon the wall  
**Watching**  
Steals the time and gives it all  
**To the morning**  

At my window I will be  
**Watching**  
For your ships to sail to me  
**In the morning**  

# The Mountain Dew  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

**Aye a-diddlee aye dul dum** (NOTE:  This is called "lilting." Sing this exactly, all the time, without fail. Note: drinking makes this easier. Also, Bones is da Bess.)  
**Diddlee oodle aye dul dum**  
**Diddlee doo rye diddlee aye ay ***[x2]*  

Let grasses grow and water flow in a free and easy way  
Just give me enough of the rare old stuff that’s grown near Galway Bay  
The police men from old Donegal, Sligo and Lietrim, too  
We’ll give them the slip and we’ll take a sip of the rare old mountain dew  

At the foot of the hill there’s a neat little still where the smoke curls up to the sky  
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell there’s poitin (NOTE:  Pronounced ‘potcheen’: an Irish beverage distilled from potatoes or barley – so incredibly alcoholic (60 – 95% abv) that for centuries it was illegal in Ireland. ) brewing nearby  
It fills the air with odor rare, but betwixt both me and you  
When home we go you can take a bowl or a bucket of the mountain dew  

Now learned men who use the pen have wrote your praises high  
That sweet poitin from Ireland green is stilled from wheat and rye  
Put away your pills, it’ll cure all ills, be you Pagan or Christian or Jew  
Take off your coat and grease your throat with a bucket of the mountain dew  

# Nancy Whiskey   
** **  
**Whiskey whiskey, Nancy Whiskey**  
**Whiskey whiskey, Nancy-O!**  
**Whiskey whiskey, Nancy Whiskey**  
**Whiskey whiskey, Nancy-O!**  

I am a weaver, a Carlton weaver,  
I am a brash and a roving blade,  
I got silver in my britches,  
And I follow the roving trade  

I went into Glasgow city,  
Nancy Whiskey I did smell,  
I walked in, sat down beside her,  
Seven long years; I loved her well  

The more I kissed her, the more I knew her,  
The more I loved her, the more she smiled,  
I forgot my mother's teaching,  
Nancy soon had me beguiled!  

Woke up early in the morning,  
Lying halfway off the bed,  
Tried to rise, but I was not able,  
Nancy damn near knocked me dead!  

I'll get back to the Carlton weaving,  
Surely make those shuttles fly,  
I'll make more at the Carlton weaving,  
Than ever I did at the roving way  

All you weavers, you Carlton weavers,  
All you weavers where e'er you be,  
Beware of whiskey, Nancy Whiskey,  
She'll ruin you as she ruined me!  

# The Night That Paddy Murphy Died  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

Oh, the night that Paddy Murphy died is a night I’ll never forget  
Some of the boys got loaded drunk, and they ain’t been sober yet  
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feeling gay  
O’Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play  

**That’s how they showed their respect for Paddy Murphy**  
**That’s how they showed their honor and their pride**  
**They said it was a sin and shame and they winked at one another**  
**And every drink in the place was full the night Pat Murphy died**  

As Mrs. Murphy sat in the corner pouring out her grief  
Kelly and his gang came tearing down the street  
They went into an empty room and a bottle of whiskey stole  
They put the bottle with the corpse to keep that whiskey cold  

About two o’clock in the morning after emptying the jug  
Doyle rolls up the icebox lid to see poor Paddy’s mug  
We stopped the clock so Mrs. Murphy couldn’t tell the time  
And at a quarter after two we argued it was nine  

They stopped the hearse on George Street outside some damn saloon  
They all went in at half past eight and staggered out at noon  
They went up to the graveyard, so holy and sublime  
Found out when they got there, they’d left the corpse behind  

Oh, `rphy died is a night I’ll never forget  
Some of the boys got loaded drunk and they ain’t been sober yet  
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feeling gay  
O’Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play  

# Northwest Passage   
Stan Rogers   
   
** ****Ah for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage **  
** To find the hand of Franklin reaching for the Beaufort Sea **  
** Tracing one warm line through a land so wide and savage **  
** And make a Northwest Passage to the sea**   
   
Westward through the Davis Strait ‘tis there ‘twas said to lie   
The sea route to the Orient for which so many died   
Come seeking gold and glory, leaving weathered broken bones   
And a long forgotten lonely cairn of stones   
   
Three centuries thereafter, I take passage overland   
In the footsteps of brave Kelso, where his sea of flowers began   
Watching cities rise before me, then behind me sink again   
This tardiest explorer driving hard across the plain   
   
And through the night, behind the wheel, the mileage clicking west   
I think upon MacKenzie, David Thompson and the rest   
Who cracked the mountain ramparts and did show a path for me   
To race the roaring Fraser to the sea   
   
How then am I so different from the first men through this way?   
Like them I left a settled life, I threw it all away   
To seek a Northwest Passage at the call of many men   
To find there but the road back home again  

# The North Sea Shoals  
From Tripple Nipple Jones  

Come all you gallant fishermen that plough the stormy sea,  
The whole year round on the fishing grounds  
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.  

It's there you'll find the Norfolk boys and the lads from Peterhead,  
There's Buckie chiels and men from Shields,  
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.  

From Fraserborough and Aberdeen, from Whitby, Yarmouth Town,  
The fleet's away at the break of day  
To the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
To the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.  

It's off with a boiler full of steam and your engine spic and span  
To fish the grounds the North Sea round  
And fish and knolls and the North Sea Holes  
And try your luck at the North Shields Gut  
With a catch of a hundred cran.  

No need to wait for the wind and tide, you're the master of the sea,  
Come calm or squall, just shoot and haul  
And fill the hold with the fish to be sold  
And steam ahead for the curing shed  
And the buyers on the Yarmouth quay.  

Come all you gallant fishermen that plough the stormy sea,  
The whole year round on the fishing grounds  
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.  


# The Old Churchyard  
From The Watersons’ 2002 album *A Dark Light*  

Come, come with me out to the old churchyard,  
I so well know those paths 'neath the soft green sward.  
Friends slumber in there that we want to regard;  
We will trace out their names in the old churchyard.  

Mourn not for them, their trials are o'er,  
And why weep for those who will weep no more?  
For sweet is their sleep, though cold and hard  
Their pillows may be in the old churchyard.  

I know that it's vain when our friends depart  
To breathe kind words to a broken heart;  
And I know that the joy of life is marred  
When we follow lost friends to the old churchyard.  

But were I at rest 'neath yonder tree,  
Oh, why would you weep, my friends, for me?  
I'm so weary, so wayworn, why would you retard  
The peace I seek in the old churchyard?  

Why weep for me, for I'm anxious to go  
To that haven of rest where no tears ever flow;  
And I fear not to enter that dark lonely tomb  
Where our saviour has lain and conquered the gloom.  

I rest in the hope that one bright day  
Sunshine will burst to these prisons of clay,  
And old Gabriel's trumpet and voice of the Lord  
Will wake up the dead in the old churchyard.  

# Old Dun Cow  

Some friends and I in a public house were playin’ dominoes one night  
When into the room a fireman came, his face all chalky white   
"What’s up," says Brown, “Have you seen a ghost? Have you seen your Aunt Mariah?”  
"Oh me Aunt Mariah be buggered," said he, “The bleedin’ pub’s on fire!”  

"Oh" says Brown, “what a bit o’ luck, everybody follow me  
It’s down to the cellar, if the fire’s not there, we’ll have a grand old spree!"  
So we all went down with good old Brown, and the booze we could not miss,  
And we hadn’t been there ten minutes or more ‘til we were quite like this: oh  

**There was Brown, upside down, moppin’ up the whiskey on the floor,**  
**"Booze! Booze!" the firemen cried, as they came a-knockin’ at the door;**  
**Oh don’t let ‘em in ‘til it’s all ****drunk ****up, somebody shouted "MacIntyre!" (MacIntyre!!!)**  
**And we all got blue blind paralytic drunk when the Old Dun Cow caught fire**.  

Then Smith went over to the port wine tub and gave it just two hard knocks,  
Started takin’ off his pantaloons, likewise his shoes and socks;  
"Hold on," says Brown, “That ain’t allowed, you can’t do that in here!  
Don’t be washing your trousers in the port wine tub when we’ve got [Genesee] beer!"  

Oh, then there came a mighty crash, half the bloody roof caved in,  
We were drownin’ in the fireman’s hose, though we were almost happy,  
So we got some tacks and some old wet sacks, and we tacked ourselves inside,  
And we sat there getting bleary-eyed drunk when the Old Dun Cow caught fire.   
# Old Turf Fire  
**Oh the old turf fire**  
**And the hearth swept clean**  
**Sure there's no one half so happy**  
**As meself and Paddy Keane**  
**With the baby in the cradle**  
**You can hear her mammy say**  
**Ah wouldn't you go to sleep Alanna**  
**‘Til I wet your Daddy's tea*.**  

Oh I've got a little house  
And a tidy bit of land  
Sure you'd never see the better  
On this side of Cnoc na gCrann**  
I've no piano in the corner  
And no pictures on the wall  
Ah but sure I'm quite contented  
In me little marble hall.  

Oh the man that I work for  
Is a richer man than me  
But somehow I'll be telling you  
We never can agree.  
He has big towering mansions  
And he's castles over all  
But sure I'd never exchange with him  
Me little marble hall  

Oh the old turf fire  
What a welcome now it brings  
As the cricket chirrups gaily  
And the kettle also sings  
We all join in the chorus  
Of a merry lilting song  
With the friendly neighbours dropping in  
To join in the happy throng.  

Round the old turf fire  
Sit the old folk bent with years  
As they watch us tripping lightly  
And they're smilin' through their tears  
For so sadly they are dreaming  
Of their youthful hearts desire  
And those dear old days so long ago  
Round the old turf fire.  

*Pronounced "tay"           **Pronounced “Knock nuh cran”  

# P Stands For Paddy  

P Stands For Paddy  
As went out one fine morning  
For to take a little walk  
I sat myself down by an old stone wall  
To hear two lovers talk.To hear two lovers talk, me love  
To hear what they might say  
That I might learn a little of love before I go away.  

**And ‘P’ stands for Paddy, I suppose**  
**‘J’ for my love John **  
**And ‘W’ stands for false Willy-o **  
**But Johnny is the fairest man.**  
**Oh, Johnny is the fairest man, she cried**  
**Johnny is the fairest man**  
**Oh I don’t care what anybody says, for Johnny is the fairest man.**  

Oh I won’t sit beside you, love,  
Not now or any other time  
For you, you love another pretty maid  
And your heart’s no longer mine.  
Your heart’s no longer mine, she cried  
You heart’s no longer mine  
For you, you love another pretty maid and your heart’s no longer mine.  

Well I will climb a high high tree   
And rob a little bird’s nest  
And I will take whatever I can find   
To the arms I love the best.  
To the arms I love the best, she cried  
The arms I love the best  
Oh, I will take whatever I can find to the arms I love the best.  

# Paddy Doyle’s Boots   
   
**To me way, ay, ay, ay, ay, ah!**   
We’ll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots   
   
We’ll all throw mud at the cook   
   
That dirty old man on the poop   
   
We’ll all drink whiskey and gin   
   
We’ll all shave under our chin   
   
We’ll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots  

# Paddy Lay Back   
   
’Twas a cold a dreary morning in December *(December) *  
An’ all of me money it was spent *(spent spent) *  
Where it went to, Lord I can’t remember *(remember) *  
So down to the shipping office I went *(went went) *  
   
**Paddy lay back ***(Paddy lay back!)***_ _**  
**Take in the slack** *(Take in the slack!) *  
**Take a turn around the capstan heave a pawl ***(Heave a pawl!)***_ _**  
**About ship’s stations, boys, be handy ***(Be handy!)***_ _**  
**For we’re bound for Valipariso ’round the Horn **  
** **  
That day there was a great demand for sailors   
For the colonies, for ’Frisco and for France   
So I shipped aboard a limey barque *The Hotspur *  
And got paralytic drunk on my advance   
   
I woke up in the morning sick and sore-o   
And I knew that I was outward bound again   
When I heard a voice a-bawling at the door-o   
"Lay aloft ye sods and answer to your names!"   
   
’Twas on the quarter deck where first I saw ’em   
Such an ugly bunch I never seen before   
For there was a bum and stiff from every quarter   
And it made me poor old heart feel sick and sore   
   
There was Spaniards and Dutchmen and Rooshians   
And Johnny Crappos just across from France *(Vive La France!)*   
And most of ’em couldn’t speak a word of English   
But they answered to the name of "Month’s Advance"   
   
I asked the mate a-which a-watch was mine-o   
Says he "I’ll soon pick out a-which is which"   
And he blowed me down and kicked me hard astern-o   
Calling me a lousy dirty son-of-a-bitch   
   
So there I was a-once more out to sea boys   
The same ol’ bloody business o’er again   
Oh, stamp the capstan ’round and make some noise, boys  
And sing again this dear ol’ sweet refrain  

# Paddy’s Lament  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

Well it's by the hush, me boys, and that’s to mind your noise  
And listen to poor Paddy's sad narration  
For I was by hunger pressed, and in poverty distressed  
So I took a thought to leave the Irish nation  

**Hear me, boys, now take my advice**  
**To America I'll have ye not be going**  
**There is nothing here but war, where the murderin' cannons roar**  
**And I wish I was at home in dear old Dublin**  

Well I sold me horse and cow, my little pigs and sow  
My father’s plot of land I soon departed  
And me sweetheart Bidd McGee, I'm afraid I'll never see  
For I left her there that morning broken-hearted  

Well meself and a hundred more, to America sailed o'er  
Our fortunes to be makin’ we were thinkin'  
But when we got to Yankee land, they shoved a gun into our hands  
Saying, "Paddy, you must go and fight for Lincoln"  

General Meagher to us he said, if you get shot or lose your head  
Every mother’s son of you will get a pension  
Well in the war I lost me leg; all I have’s this wooden peg,  
And by God this is the truth to you I mention  

Well I think meself in luck, if I get fed on Indian buck  
And old Ireland is the country I delight in  
With the devil, I do say, it's curse Americay  
For I think I've had enough of your hard fightin’  

# Paddy on the Railway  
From Meister Jaeger  

In 1841 I put me corduroy britches on  
I put me corduroy britches on  
To work upon the railway   

**Tira me ori ori ay, tira me ori ori ay**  
**Tira me ori ori ay, to work upon the railway **  

In 1842 I left the old land for the new  
Bad cess to the luck that brought me through  
To work upon the railway   

In 1843 we hit Chicago on a spree  
The devil got a hold of me  
While working on the railway   

In 1844 while standing on the great lake shore  
We laid the track then saw no more  
While working on the railway   

In 1845 when Daniel O'Connell was alive  
In Kansas City we did arrive  
To work upon the railway   

In 1846 had a pain in me ass from carrying bricks  
With hammers and nails and shovels and picks  
A working upon the railway   

It's Paddy do this and Paddy do that  
Without a stocking or cravat *(or: me boss is loud, and he is fat)*  
And nothing but an old straw hat *(I’ve had enough shite to fill up me hat)*  
While working on the railway   

In 1848 me hands did blister and me belly did ache  
We heard of gold and made a stake  
While working on the railway   

In 1849 the California hills looked fine  
We found some gold and left behind  
The workings of the railway  



# The Parting Glass  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

Oh, all the money that e’er I spent, I spent it in good company  
And all the harm that e’er I’ve done, alas, it was to none but me  
And all I’ve done for want of wit to mem’ry now I can’t recall  
So fill to me the parting glass, good night and joy be with you all  

Oh, all the comrades that e’er I’ve had, they are sorry for my going away  
And all the sweethearts that e’er I’ve had, would wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not  
I’ll gently rise and I’ll softly call good night and joy be with you all  
Good night, and joy be with you all  

# The Peat Fire Flame  
From The Whip!  

Far away and o'er the moor,  
Morar waits for a boat that saileth,  
Far away down Lowland way,  
I dream the dream I learned, lad,  

**By the light o' the peat-fire flame,**  
**Light for love, for lilt o' laughter,**  
**By the light o' the peat-fire flame,**  
**The light the hill-folk yearn for.**  

Far away, down Lowland way,  
Grim's the toil, without tune or dream, lad,  
All you need's a creel and love,  
For the dream the heart can weave, lad  

Far away the tramp and tread,  
Tune and laughter of all the heroes,  
Pulls me onward o'er the trail  
Of the dream my heart may weave, lad,

    <td>I once met a lass so fine
She was drunk on barley wine
I’d been to sea for months a’three
I knew I could make her mine
And the lass was past consent
So it’s off with her we went
And we threw her in bed and rested her head
And we left because that’s what gentlemen do

A woman has a right to a drink or two 
Without worrying about what you will do
We say yo ho but we don’t say ho
‘Cause ho is disrespectful, yo

There once was a gal from Leeds
Who I’d heard was good on her knees
So I docked my ship for an overnight trip 
to take care of all my needs
She was fine as the tales did tell
And my mast began to swell
So I laid her down and raised her gown
And performed cunnilingus for an hour or so

Always take care of your lady fair
‘Cause they deserve as much attention down there
We say yo ho…

I once had a woman so fair
Whose womb contained my heir
With a son by my side, the seas we’d ride
The child she would bear
But my girl she was no fool
She was working her way through school
So I did support when she chose to abort, 
because it’s her body and therefore her choice</td>
    <td>No we don’t say booty ‘less we’re talkin ‘bout gold
We don’t look at chests ‘less they treasure hold
With a hat and a feather and a cutlass on our hip
We don’t ever say she when we’re talking ‘bout a ship
We don’t say bitch and we don’t say whore
‘Cause that language leads to things like body dysmorphia

There was a lady with a golden eye
And the doctor said she would die
So she emptied her purse to lift the curse
And prayed to stay alive
She awoke the very next day
And in her grave she lay
But the scariest part of the story from the start
Is I bet you assumed the doctor was a man

Women are doctors, too
And for a fraction of the doubloons
We say yo ho…

There was a slut with tits to here
And an ass that –

‘Cause it’s yo ho but we don’t say ho
‘Cause ho is disrespectful, yo</td>

# The Pirates Who Don’t Do Anything  
From Vitamin Seal  

**We are the pirates we don't do anything**  
**We just stay at home and lie around**  
**And if you ask us to do anything**  
**We'll just tell you, we don't do anything**  

Well I've never been to Greenland, and I've never been to Denver  
And I've never buried treasure in St. Louie or St. Paul  
And I've never been to Moscow, and I've never been to Tampa  
And I've never been to Boston in the fall  

**Chorus**  

And I've never hoist the main sail, and I've never swabbed the poop deck  
And I've never veered starboard 'cause I've never sailed at all  
And I've never walked the gang plank, and I've never owned a parrot  
And I've never been to Boston in the fall  

**Chorus**  

Oh, I've never plucked a rooster and I am not too good at ping-pong  
And I've never thrown my mashed potatoes up against the wall  
And I've never kissed a chipmunk, and I've never gotten head lice  
And I have never been to Boston in the fall  
Pirate captains log 2002 who'll be this band Relient K  
And why they'll be so full of contradictions  
We don't know what he did but we're down with Captain Kidd  
We don't wake up before lunch but we all eat Captain Crunch  
We don't smoke, we don't chew, we watch Captain Kangaroo  
{Ladies and gentlemen let's give them a big hand}  

**Chorus x 2**  



# A Professional Pirate  

When I was just a lad looking for my true vocation    
My father said "Now son, this choice deserves deliberation    
Though you could be a doctor or perhaps a financier    
My boy why not consider a more challenging career"    
   
Hey ho ho    
You'll cruise to foreign shores    
And you'll keep your mind and body sound    
By working out of doors    
True friendship and adventure are what we can't live without    
And when you're a professional pirate    
That's what the job's about   
    
Now take Sir Francis Drake, the Spanish all despise him    
But to the British he's a hero and they idolize him    
It's how you look at buccaneers that makes them bad or good    
And I see us as members of a noble brotherhood    
   
Hey ho ho    
We're honorable men    
And before we lose our tempers we will always count to ten    
On occasion there may be someone you have to execute    
But when you’re a professional pirate    
You don't have to wear a suit.....what?    
   
I could have been a surgeon    
I like taking things apart    
   
I could have been a lawyer    
But I just had too much heart    
   
I could have been in politics    
Cause I've always been a big spender    
   
And me...I could have been a contender    
   
Some say that pirates steal and should be feared and hated    
I say we're victims of bad press it's all exaggerated    
We'd never stab you in the back, we'd never lie or cheat    
We're just about the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet    
   
Hey ho ho    
It's one for all for one    
And we'll share and share alike with you and love you like a son    
We're gentlemen of fortune and that's what we're proud to be    
And when you’re a professional pirate    
You'll be honest brave and free    
The soul of decency    
You'll be loyal and fair and on the square    
And most importantly    
When you're a professional pirate    
You're always in the best of company  

# Pull Down Below  
   
I went to church and I went to chapel  
**Pull down below!**  
I went to church and I went to chapel  
**Pull down below!**  

**Oh, Hieland Laddie**  
**Pull down below!**  
**Hieland laddie, bonny laddie**  
**Pull down below!**  

Out on the road I found a saddle  
I found a saddle and an empty poke  

I found a saddle and an empty poke  
But where the hell is the bleedin' moke  

The moke is gone and I'll go too  
I'll sail away to Backaloo  

Oh, hoist 'er up and away we'll go  
Hoist 'er up from down below  

Oh, giver 'er sheet and let 'er go  
We're outward bound to Backalow

It's one more pull and then belay

**Pump me boys, pump her dry **  
**Down to hell and up to the sky **  
**Bend your back and break your bones **  
**We’re just a thousand miles from home **  
   
They say life has its ups and downs   
That really now is quite profound   
I’d like to push the capstan round   
But it’s pump me boys before we drown   
   
The captain's daughter I suppose   
Could be called an English Rose   
What would you think when I propose   
The pox she gave to me a dose.   
   
This rose well she did prick me sore   
I never felt so bad before   
Thanks to the girl I do adore   
I thought I'd never pump no more.   
   
I called the doctor right away   
To find out what he had to say   
That's two pounds ten, get on your way   
I'm sure this girl is in his pay.   
   
Sometimes while lying in me bed   
And thinking of me day ahead   
I wish that I could wake up dead   
But pumpin's all I get instead   
   
The ocean we all do adore    
So come on lads let's pump some more   
Don't worry if you’re stiff and sore   
I'm sure we've pumped this bit before..   
   
There's so much water down below    
Just how it got there I don't know   
The old man says let's roll and go   
But I think we're bound for Davey Jones.  

# Rambling Soldier  

I am a soldier, I do say  
That rambles for promotion  
 I’ve laid the French and the Spaniards low   
Some miles upon the ocean  
Come, now me jolly boys,  
I bid you all adieu  
No more to the wars will I go with you  
But I’ll ramble the country through and through   
And I’ll be a rambling solider  

The King he has commanded me   
To range this country over  
From Woolwich up to Liverpool  
And from Plymouth back to Dover  
A’courtin’ all the girls,   
Both old and young,  
With me ramrod in me hand and me flattery tongue  
To court them all but marry none  
And I’ll be a rambling soldier  

And when these wars are at an end  
I’m not afraid to mention  
The King will hand me my discharge,  
A guinea and a pension  
No doubt some lassies will me blame  
But none of them will know my name  
And if you want to know the same  
My name is Rambling Soldier  

… And they call me a rambling soldier  

# Randy Dandy-O  
From Tripple Nipple Jones  

Now we are ready to head for the horn,  
**Way, hey, roll an’ go!**  
Our boots and our clothes boys are all in the pawn,  
**To me rollickin’ randy dandy-o!**  

**Heave a pawl,** (NOTE:  A ratcheting device on the capstan that prevented it from turning backward.)** oh, heave away,**  
**Way, hey, roll an' go!**  
**The anchor's on board an' the cable's all stored,**  
**To me rollickin' randy dandy-o!**  

Sing goodbye to Sally an' goodbye to Sue  
For we are the boy-os who can kick 'er through  

Come breast the bars, bullies, an' heave her away  
Soon we'll be rollin' her 'way down the Bay  

Roust 'er up, bullies, the wind's drawin' free  
So get on yer glad rags (NOTE:  Best clothes or clothes used on special occasions) an' drive 'er to sea    

We're outward bound for Valipo Bay,  
Get crackin', me lads, 'tis a hell of a way!  


# Rant and Roar   
** **  
**We'll rant and we'll roar like true Newfoundlanders**  
**We'll rant and we'll roar on deck and below**  
**Until we strikes bottom inside the two sunkers**  
**When straight through the channel to Toslow we'll go**  

I'm a son of a sea cook; I'm a cook and a trader  
I can dance, I can sing, I can reef the main boom  
I can handle a jigger, I cuts a fine figure  
Whenever I gets in a boat standing room  

Farewell and adieu to ye young maids of Valen  
Oderin and Presque, Fox Hole and Bruley  
I'm bound for the westward to the wall with the hole in  
I can't marry all or a chokey I'll be  

# Red-Haired Mary  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

While going to the fair of Dingle  
One fine morning last July  
When going down the road before me  
A red-haired girl I chanced to spy  

I went to her, said, "aye, young lady,  
My donkey he will carry two  
And seeing how you have no donkey  
To the Dingle fair I’ll ride with you"  

Now when we reached the town of Dingle  
I took her hand to say goodbye  
When a tinker man stepped up beside me  
And he belted me in my left eye  

**Keep your hands off red-haired Mary**  
**Her and I will soon be wed**  
**We’ll see the priest this very morning**  
**Tonight we’ll lie in a marriage bed**  

Now I was feeling kinda peevish  
And me poor old eye was sad and sore  
And I gently tapped him with my hobnails  
And he flew back through Murphy’s door  

A policeman came around the corner  
And he told me I had broke the law  
When the donkey kicked him in the kneecap  
And he fell down and broke his jaw  

Then he went off to find his brother  
The biggest man you ever did see  
He gently tapped me with his knuckles  
And I was minus two front teeth  

Now the red-haired girl she kept on smiling  
"I’ll go with you, young man," she said  
"We’ll forget the priest this very morning  
And tonight we’ll lie in Murphy’s shed"  

**Keep your hands off red-haired Mary**  
**Her and I will soon be wed**  
**We’ll forget the priest this very morning**  
**Tonight we’ll lie in Murphy’s shed**  

Now through the fair we rode together  
My black eye and her red hair  
Smiling gaily at the tinkers  
And my God we were a handsome pair!  

# Rio Grande  

Oh say were you ever in Rio Grande?  
**Oh, you Rio!**  
It’s there that the river runs down golden sand  

**And we’re bound for the Rio Grande**  
**Then away, love, away**  
**Oh! You Rio!**  
**Sing fare-ye-well to my pretty young girl**  
**And we’re bound for the Rio Grande**  

This old New York town is no place for me  
I’ll pack up my sea-chest and get off to sea  

Now all you beach comers we’ll have you to know  
We’re bound for the south’ard and glad for to go  

So it’s put down your bag and get it unpacked  
The sooner we leave here the quicker we’re back  

There’s some of us sick and there’s some of us sore  
We’ve scoffed all our whack and we’re looking for more  

Our ship went sailing out over the bar  
We pointed her nose towards the southern star  

Them Liverpool judies they never use combs  
They comb out their locks with a haddock’s backbone  

It’s goodbye to Ellen and sweet Molly too  
Ye Parkee Lane chowlahs ‘tis goodbye to you  

Cheer up Mary Ellen an’ don’t look so glum  
On white stockin’ day ye’ll be drinkin’ hot rum  

We’ve a bully good ship with a bully good crew  
But we don’t like the grub, no I’m damned if we do  

The anchor is weighed and our sails are all set  
The girls that we’re leaving we’ll never forget  


# The Rocky Road To Dublin  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

In the merry month of June from my home I started  
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken-hearted  
Saluted me Father dear, kissed me darlin’ Mother  
Drank a pint of beer, my grief and tears to smother  
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born  
I cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins  
Bought a pair of brogues, rattlin’ o’er the bogs  
And frightened all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin  

**One, two, three, four, five!**  
**Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road**  
**All the way to Dublin, whack fol-lol-de-ra**  

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary  
Started by daylight next morning bright and airy  
Took a drop of the pure to keep my heart from sinking  
That’s the Paddy’s cure, whene’er he’s on for drinking  
To see the lassies smile, laughing all the while  
At my curious style, ’twould set your heart a-bubbling  
Asked if I was hired, wages I required  
’Till I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin  

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity  
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city  
So then I took a stroll out among the quality  
My bundle it was stolen in a neat locality  
Something crossed my mind, when I looked behind  
No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin’  
Enquiring for the rogue, found me Connaught brogue  
Wasn’t much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin  

From there I got away, me spirits never failing  
Landed on the quay just as the ship was sailing  
The captain at me roared, said that no room had he  
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy  
Down among the pigs, played some funny rigs  
Danced some hearty jigs, the water ’round me bubbling  
When off Holyhead, wished meself was dead  
Or better far, instead, on the rocky road to Dublin  

The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed  
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it  
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing  
Poor old Erin’s isle they began abusing  
"Hurrah me soul!" says I, shillelagh I let fly  
Some Galway boys were nigh, they saw I was a-hobblin’  
With a loud "Hurray!" they joined in the affray  
We quickly cleared the way, for the rocky road to Dublin  

# Roll Alabama Roll  

When the Alabama's keel was laid,  
**Roll, Alabama, roll!**  
It was laid in the yard of Jonathan Laird.  
**Oh, roll, Alabama, roll!**  

Down the Mersey ways she rolled then;  
Liverpool fitted her with guns and men.  

From the Western Isles she sailed forth,  
To destroy the commerce of the North.  

The Alabama sailed for two whole years,  
Took sixty-five ships in her career.  

*With British guns, oh, she was stocked;*  
*She sailed from Fayal; in Cherbourg she docked.*  

To Cherbourg port she sailed one dayTo collect her share of the prize money.  

*But off Cherbourg the Kearsarge lay tight,*  
*With Cap'n Winslow spoilin' for a fight.*  

Many a sailor lad saw his doom,  
When the Yankee Kearsarge hove in view.  

'Twas a ball from the forward pivot that day,  
Shot the Alabama's keel away.  

Off the three-mile limit, in sixty-four,  
They sent the Alabama to the cold ocean floor.  

When the Alabama’s keel was laid,  
It was laid in the yard of Jonathan Laird.  

# Roll Down  
Capstan Chantey by Peter Bellamy  

Sweet ladies of Ply-mouth, we bid you good-bye,  
**Roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down!**  
We will rock you and roll you again by and by,  
**Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down**  

**And we will roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down,**  
**Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down!**  

The anchor's away and the sails are unfurled,  
We're bound for to sail her halfway 'round the world,  

In the deep Bay of Biscay the seas do run high,  
Them poor weary transports they'll wish they could die,  

When the great southern whales on our quarter do spout,  
Them poor weary transports, they'll goggle and shout,  

When at last we draw near to Australia's bold strand,  
Them poor weary transports, they'll long for the land,  

Then, sweet ladies of Plymouth, we'll pay all your rent,  
And go roving no more till our money's all spent,  

# Roll The Woodpile Down  

Oh way down south where the cocks do crow  
**Way down in Florida**  
Them girls all dance to the old banjo  
**And we’ll roll the woodpile down!**  

**Rollin’! Rollin’! Rollin’! Rollin’! **  
**Rollin’ the whole world ‘round**  
**That girl of mine on the Georgia Line**  
**And we’ll roll the woodpile down!**  

We’ll roll him high and we’ll roll him low  
We’ll heave him up and away we’ll go  

Oh, roust and bust her is the cry  
A sailor’s wage is never high  

O Curly goes on the ol’ ran-tan  
O Curly’s jist a Down-East man  

Oh one more heave and that’ll do  
For we’re the bullies to kick her through  




















# Roll Your Leg Over  
** **  
**Roll your leg over **  
**And roll your leg over **  
**And roll your leg over **  
**It’s better that way **  
** **  
If all the young lassies were locks on a gate   
Then I’d be the key to insert and rotate   
   
If all the young lassies were boats on the ocean    
Then I’d be the waves and I’d show ’em the motion   

If all the young lassies were telephone poles   
Then I’d be the squirrel to crack nuts in their holes   
   
If all the young lassies were sheep in the clover   
Then I’d and I’d ram and I’d ram ’em all over   
   
If all the young lassies were winds of the sea   
Then I’d be a sail and I’d let them blow me   
   
If all the young laddies were pipes in the yard   
Then after I drained ’em they’d still remain hard   
   
If laddies were watches in shiny gold cases   
Then I’d be the hands and I’d sit on their faces   
   
If all the young laddies were camels to pack   
I'd hump them all day, and I'd never spit back   
   
If all the young laddies were coconuts sweet   
Then I’d suck out their juices and chew on their meat   
   
If all the young laddies were needles and pins   
Then I’d be cushion to hold their pricks in   
   
If all the young laddies were puppies full grown   
Then I’d be the ground where they’d bury their bone   
   
If all the young laddies were singing this song   
It’d be over too quick and it’d be half as long  

# Rollin’ Down To Old Maui  
The first song the crew ever forgot during a show  
   
It’s a damn tough life full of toil and strife we whalermen undergo   
And we don’t give a damn when the whaling’s done how hard the winds did blow   
‘Cause we’re homeward bound from the Arctic Ground with a good ship taut and free   
And we won’t give a damn when we drink our rum with the girls of old Maui   
   
**Rollin’ down to old Maui, me boys, rollin’ down to old Maui **  
**We’re homeward bound from the Arctic Ground, rollin’ down to old Maui**   
   
Once more we sail with the northerly gale through the ice and wind and rain   
Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands, we soon shall see again   
Six hellish months we’ve passed away on the cold Kamchatka Sea,   
But now we’re bound from the Arctic Ground, rollin’ down to old Maui   
   
Once more we sail with the northerly gale towards our island home   
Our main mast sprung, our whaling done, and we ain’t got far to roam   
Our stuns’l boom’s been carried away, what care we for that sound   
A living gale is after us, thank God we’re homeward bound   
   
And now we’re anchored in the bay, with kamakas all around   
With chants and sweet alo-o-o-has, they greet us homeward bound   
And now ashore, we’ll have good friends, we’ll paint the beaches red   
Awaken in the arms of an island maid with a **big fat achin’ head**  

# The Rolling Hills Of The Border  

**When I die, bury me low,**  
**Where I can hear the bonny Tweed flow,**  
**A sweeter place I never did know,**  
**The rolling hills o’ the border**  

I have travelled far and wide,  
Seen the Hudson and seen the Clyde,  
I’ve courted by Loch Lomond’s side  
But I dearly love the border  

Often I have mind o’ the day  
With my lass, I strolled by the Tay,  
But all its beauty fades away  
Among the hills o’ the border  

There’s a certain peace of mind  
Bonnie lasses there you’ll find  
Men so sturdy, men so kind  
Among the hills of the border  

# Rosin the Beau  
From The Whip! and Old Navy Jones  

I've traveled this wide world all over,  
And now to another I go.  
**I know that good quarters are waiting**  
**To welcome old Rosin the Beau.**  

**To welcome old Rosin the Beau. (x2)**  
**I know that good quarters are waiting**  
**To welcome old Rosin the Beau.**  

When I'm dead and laid out on the counter  
A voice you will hear from below,  
**Saying "Send down a hogshead of whisky**  
**To drink with old Rosin the Beau."**  

Then get a half-dozen stout fellows  
And stack them all up in a row  
**Let them drink out of half-gallon bottles**  
**To the memory of Rosin the Beau**  

Then get a half-dozen stout fellows  
And let them all stagger and go  
**And dig a great hole in the meadow**  
**And in it put Rosin the Beau.**  

Then get ye a couple of bottles;  
Put one at me head and me toe.  
**With a diamond ring scratch upon 'em**  
**The name of old Rosin the Beau.**  

I feel that old tyrant approaching,  
That cruel and remorseless old foe,  
**And I lift up me glass in his honor,**  
**Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau.**  
# Row On  
   
Clouds are upon the summer sky   
There's thunder in the wind   
Pull on, pull on, and homeward hie   
Nor give one look behind   
   
**Row on, row on, another day **  
**May shine with brighter light **  
**Ply, ply the oars and pull away **  
**There’s dawn beyond the night **  
   
Bear where thou goest the words of love   
Say all that words can say   
Changeless affection, strength to prove   
But speed upon the way   
   
Like yonder river would I glide   
To where my heart would be   
My barque should soon out-sail the tide   
That hurries to the sea   
   
But yet a star shines constant still   
Through yonder cloudy sky   
And hope as bright my bosom fills   
From faith that cannot die   
   
Row on, row on, God speed the way   
Thou must not linger here   
Storms hang about the closing day   
Tomorrow may be clear  

# Santiano  

Oh, Santiano gained the day  
**Away Santiano**   
Oh, Santiano gained the day  
**All on the plains of Mexico**  

To Mexico, oh Mexico   
To Mexico, where I must go  

O! Santiano had a wooden leg  
He used it for a cribbage peg  

O! Santiano fought for his gold  
The deeds he did have oft been told  

He won the day at Molly-Del-Rey,  
And General Taylor he ran away.  

O! Santiano fought for his life,  
He gained his way in the terrible strife.  

O! Santiano's men were brave,  
Many found a hero's grave.  

O! Santiano's day is o'er,  
Santiano will fight no more.  

O! Santiano's day is gorn,  
We left him buried off Cape Horn.  

We dug his grave with a golden spade,  
And marked the spot where he was laid.  

# Saucy Sailor  

Come me own one, come me fair one  
Come now unto me  
Could ye fancy a poor sailor lad   
Who has just come from the sea?  

Oh you’re ragged, love, and you’re dirty, love  
And your clothes smell much of tar  
So be gone you saucy sailor lad  
So be gone you Jack Tar  

If I’m ragged, love, and I’m dirty, love  
And me clothes smell much of tar  
I have silver in me pocket, love  
And gold in great store  

And then when she heard him say so  
On her bended knees she fell:  
I will marry my dear Henry,  
For I love the sailor lads so well!  

Do you think that I, I am foolish love?  
Do you think that I am mad?  
For to wed with a poor country girl  
Where no fortune’s to be had?  

I will cross the briny ocean,  
I will whistle and sing  
And since you’ve refused the offer, love,  
Some other girl shall wear the ring  

I am frolicsome, and I am easy,  
Good-tempered and free  
And I don’t give a single pin, me boys,   
What the world thinks of me  

*(round) *  
*La di da di da, la di da di da, *

# Seven Drunken Nights  

**As I came home on a** **Monday** **night as drunk as drunk could be **  
I saw a horse outside the door where my own horse should be   
**So, I called me wife and I said "Hey Wife, will explain to me **  
Who owns that horse outside the door where my own horse should be?"   
**_Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool, so you can not see _**  
*Why that's the lovely dairy cow me mother gave to me*   
**Well, it's many a day I've travelled a hundred miles or more **  
But a dairy cow with saddle on I’ve never seen before   

**Tuesday**  
I saw a coat behind the door where my own coat should be   
Who owns that coat behind the door where my own coat should be?"   
*That's the lovely blanket that me mother gave to me *  
But a blanket with buttons on I’ve never seen before   

**Wednesday**  
I saw a pipe upon the chair where my own pipe should be   
Who owns that pipe upon the chair where my own pipe should be?"   
*That's the lovely tin whistle that me mother gave to me*  
But a tin whistle with tobacco in it, I’ve never seen before   

**Thursday**  
I saw two boots beside the bed where my own boots should be   
Who owns those boots beside the bed where my own boots should be?"   
*They’re lovely Geranium pots me mother gave to me *  
But Geranium pots with laces on I’ve never seen before   

**Friday**  
I saw a head upon the bed where my own head should be   
Who owns that head upon the bed where my own head should be?"   
*That's a lovely baby boy me mother gave to me *  
But a baby boy with whiskers on I’ve never seen before   
   
**Saturday**  
I saw two mits upon the tits where my own mits should be   
Who owns those mits upon the tits where my old mits should be?"   
*That's the lovely lace brassiere that me mother gave to me *  
But a lace brassiere with fingernails on I’ve never seen before   

**Sunday**  
I saw a man inside the land where my own man should be  
Who owns that owns that man inside the land where my own man should be?"

# The Scotsman  
From Whiskey Richards  

Well a Scotsman clad in kilt left the bar one evening fairOne could tell by how he walked that he'd drunk more than his shareHe fumbled round until he could no longer keep his feet**Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street****Ring-ding-did-a-little-la-di-oh, Ring-di-diddly-eye-oh,He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street**About that time two young n' lovely girls just happened byOne says to the other with a twinkle in her eye"See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built,**I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt."**They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could beLifted up his kilt about an inch so they could seeAnd there behold for them to view beneath his Scottish skirt**Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth**They marveled for a moment then one said, "We must be gone.Let's leave a present for our friend before we move along."As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow**Around the bonnie star the Scot's kilt did lift and show.**Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards the treesBehind a bush he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he seesAnd in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes**"Lad I don't know you've been but I see you won first prize."**  

# Shenandoah  

Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you  
**Away, you rolling river	**  
Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you  
**Away, we’re bound away, ‘cross the wide Missour-ai**  

Oh Shenandoah, I took a notion…  
To sail across the stormy ocean…  

Oh Shenandoah, I’m bound to leave you  
But Shenandoah, I’ll not deceive you  

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughters  
I love the music of your waters  

‘Tis seven long years since last I see’d you  
But Shenandoah, I’ll never grieve you  

Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you  
Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you  

# Shiver My Timbers   
Muppet Treasure Island   
* *  
Shiver my timbers, shiver my soul   
**Yo ho heave ho **  
There are men whose hearts are as black as coal   
**Yo ho heave ho **  
   
And they sailed their ship cross the ocean blue   
A blood-thirsty captain and a cut-throat crew   
It’s as dark a tale as was ever told   
Of the lust for treasure and the love of gold   
   
Shiver my timbers, shiver my sides   
**Yo ho heave ho**   
There are hungers as strong as the wind and tides   
**Yo ho heave ho**   
   
And those buccaneers drowned their sins in rum   
The devil himself would have to call them scum   
Every man aboard would have killed his mate   
For a bag of guineas or a piece of eight   
A piece of eight! A piece of eight! *five, six, seven, eight! *  
* *   
Shiver my timbers, shiver my bones   
**Yo ho heave ho**   
There are secrets that sleep with old Davy Jones   
**Yo ho heave ho **  
   
When the mainsail’s set and the anchor’s weighed   
There’s no turning back from any course that’s laid   
And when greed and villainy sail the sea   
You can bet your boots there’ll be *treachery…* *treachery… treachery... [1 beat] oooh!*   
   
Shiver my timbers, shiver my sails   
Dead men tell no tales  

# Shoals Of Herring  
Ewan McColl  

With our nets and gear we’re faring  
On the wild and wasteful ocean  
It’s there on the deep that we harvest and reap our bread  
As we hunt the bonny shoals of herring  

It was on a fair and a pleasant day  
Out of Yarmouth harbor I was faring  
As a cabin boy on a sailing lugger  
For to hunt the bonny shoals of herring  

Now the work was hard and the hours were long  
And the treatment sure it took some bearing  
There was little kindness and the kicks were many  
As we hunted for the shoals of herring  

Oh we left the home grounds in the month of June  
And for canny Shiels we soon were bearing  
With a hundred cran of the silver darlings  
That we’d taken from the shoals of herring  

Oh we fished the Swarth and the Broken Bank  
I was a cook and I’d a quarter’s sharing  
And I used to sleep standing on me feet  
And I’d dream about the shoals of herring  

Now you’re up on deck, you’re a fisherman  
You can swear and show a manly bearing  
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows  
While you’re following the shoals of herring  

In the stormy seas and the living gales  
Just to earn the gear that I was wearing  
Sailed ten thousand miles, caught ten million fishes  
We was out there hunting shoals of herring  

And it’s night and day we’re faring  
Come winter wave or winter gale  
Sweating or cold; growing up, growing old [and dying]  
As we hunt the bonnie shoals of herring  

# South Australia  
** **  
In South Australia I was born   
**Heave away, haul away **  
South Australia, ’round Cape Horn   
**We’re bound for South Australia **  
** **  
**Haul away you rolling kings **  
**Heave away, haul away **  
**Haul away you’ll hear me say **  
**We’re bound for South Australia **  
   
If there’s just one thing that grieves my mind   
To leave Miss Nancy Blair’s behind   
   
Oh when we wallop ’round Cape Horn   
You’ll wish to God you’d never been born   
   
I wish I was in Australia’s strand   
A glass of whiskey in my hand   
   
Port Adelaide’s a grand old town   
There’s plenty of girls to go around   
   
South Australia’s my native land   
Full of flies and fleas and sand   
   
When I first shipped out to sea   
My girl said she’d be true to me   
   
South Australia’s got great waves   
Great white sharks and surfer babes   
   
Hamlet’s uncle’s got him down   
Married his mom and stole his crown   

# Spanish Ladies  

Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish Ladies,  
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain  
For we've received orders for to sail for old England  
But we hope in short time for to see you again  

**We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors,**  
**We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas**  
**Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England**  
**From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues**  

We hove our ship to with the wind from sou'west, boys  
We hove our ship to, deep soundings to take  
'Twas forty-five fathoms, with a white sandy bottom,  
So we squared our main yard and up channel did make  

The first land we sighted was call-ed the Dodman,  
Next Rame Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland and Wight  
We sailed by Beachy, by Fairlight and Dover  
And then we bore up for the South Foreland light  

Then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor,  
And all in the Downs that night for to lie  
Let go your shank painter, let go your cat stopper  
Haul up your clewgarnets, let tacks and sheets fly!  

Now let ev'ry man drink off his full bumper,  
And let ev'ry man drink off his full glass  
We'll drink and be jolly and drown melancholy,  
And here's to the health of each true-hearted lass.

The medicine go down, the medicine go down

# Sun Down Below  
Trad. West Indies, arr. Johnson Girls  

Six o'clock I hear 'em say  
**Sun down, sun down below**  
Time to quit and go away  
**Sun down, sun down below**  

**A-a-a-a-aye**  
**Sun down, sun down below**  
**A-a-a-a-aye**  
**Sun down, sun down below**  
   
Sun is down in the hole below  
Time for us to roll and go  
   
Thought I heard my captain say  
Sun is down; go get your pay  
   
Pack your duds and dinner pail  
Come back sure before we sail  
   
Six o’clock; I heard them say  
Time for us to go away  

# Take It From Day To Day  
Stan Rogers  

Well it’s not the hours of watch on watch and it’s not the work that I mind so much  
Or the long cold miles from my lover’s touch, though for sure she’s far away  
No stranger I to the touch of steel, nor the honest fear any man can feel  
But I long for dust under my heels and a pocket full of pay  
So I’ll take it from day to day  

The pack-ice ’round us cracks and groans, the old St. Roch, she creaks and moans  
The icy fog is in my bones and the ache won’t go away  
Outside I bet it’s warm and fair, I could have her fingers in my hair  
But it’s long cold miles to her out there, so I guess I’ll have to stay  
And just take it from day to day  

We’re as far north now as I want to come, but Larson’s got us under his thumb  
And I signed up for the whole damn run, I can’t get off halfway  
But when I get back onto the shore I’m going south where it stays warm  
And there’ll be someone on my arm to help me spend my pay  
So I’ll take it from day to day  *(repeat final verse)*  

# Three Fishers  

Three fishers went sailing out into the west,  
Out into the west as the sun went down,  
Each thought on the woman that loved him the best,  
And the children stood watching them out of the town.  

**For men must work and women must weep,**  
**For there's little to earn and many to keep,**  
**And the harbor bar be moaning,**  
**The harbor bar be moaning.**  

Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,  
They trimmed the lamps as the sun went down,  
And they looked at the squall and they looked at the shower,  
And the night-rack came rolling in, ragged and brown.  

**For ****women**** must work and ****men**** must weep,**  
**Though storms be sudden and the waters be deep**  
**And the harbor bar be moaning,**  
**The harbor bar be moaning.**  

Three corpses lay out on the shining sand,  
In the morning gleam as the tide went down,  
And the women were weeping and wringing their hands,  
For those who would never come back to the town.  

**For ****we all**** must work and ****we all**** must weep,**  
**And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep**  
**And good-bye to the bar and its moaning,**  
**Good-bye to the bar and its moaning.**  

# Tobacco Island   

**Off to hell we must sail for the shores of sweet Barbados**  
**Where the sugar cane grows taller than the God** (NOTE: 	Singular God. This song be about the deportation of Irish Catholics to Barbados by the Protestant English. All persons involved be monotheistic.)** we once believed in**  
**Till the butcher and his crown raped the land we used to sleep in**  
**Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes that haunt Tobacco Island**  

'Twas 1659 forgotten now for sure  
They dragged us from our homeland with the musket and their gun  
Cromwell and his roundheads battered all we know  
Shackled hopes of freedom  
We're now but stolen goods  
Dark is the horizon, blackened by the sun  
This rotten cage of Bridgetown is where I now belong  

Red leg down a peg  
Blistered burns the soul  
The floggings they're a plenty, but reasons there are none  
Our backs belong to landlords where branded is their name  
Paid for with ten shillings  
Cheap labor never breaks  
The silver moon is shinin'  
Cools the copper blood  
Where the livin' meet the dead and together dance as one  

Agony, will you cleanse this misery?  
For it's never again I'll breathe the air of home  
From this sandy edge the rolling sea breaks my revenge  
With each whisper a thousand waves I hear roar  
I'm coming home  
Dark is the horizon blackened by the sun  
This rotten cage of Bridgetown is where I now belong   

# What WIll We Do?  
From Long-Hard Susan  
What will we do if we have no money?Oh true lovers, what will we do then?I will hall through the town for a hungry crownAnd we'll yodel it over againWhat will we do if we marry a tinker?Oh true lovers, what will we do then?I will sell a tin can and walk on with me manAnd we'll yodel it over againWhat will we do if we marry a soldier?Oh true lovers, what will we do then ?All me handle is gone and I will fight for the funAnd we'll yodel it over againWhat will we do if we have a young daughter?Oh true lovers, what will we do then?I will take her in hand and we'll walk on with me manAnd we'll yodel it over againWhat will we do if we have no money?Oh true lovers, what will we do then?I will hall through the town for a hungry crownAnd we'll yodel it over again  


# Wave Over Wave  

Oh me name's Able Rodgers, a share man am IOn a three masted schooner from Twillingate IsleI've been the world over north, south, east, and westBut the middle of nowhere wheres' I likes it best**Where its wave over wave, sea over bowI'm as happy a man as the sea will allowThere****’****s no other life for a sailor like meAnd to sail the salt sea boys, sail the seaThere's no other life but to sail the salt sea**Well I leave my wife lonely ten months of the yearFor she built me a home and raised my children thereShe never come out to bid farewell to meOr ken why a sailor must sail the salt seaThe work it is hard and the hours are longBut my spirit is willing, my back it is strongAnd when the works over the whiskey will pourWe'll dance with the girls upon some foreign shoreI've sailed the world over for decades or moreAnd oft times I wonder what I do it forI don’t know the answer it’s pleasure and painBut with life to live over I'd do it again  

# The Ways Of Man  

The ways of man are passing strange  
He buys his freedom and he counts his change  
Then he lets the wind his days arrange  
And he calls the tide his master  

**Oh the days, oh the days**  
**Oh the fine long summer days**  
**The fish come rolling in the bays**  
**And he swore he'd never leave me**  

But the days grow short and the year gets old  
And the fish won't stay where the water's cold  
And if they're going to fill the hold  
They've got to go offshore to find them  

So they go outside on the raving deep  
And they pray the Lord their soul to keep  
But the waves will roll them all to sleep  
And the tide will be their keeper  

**Oh the tide, oh the tide**  
**Oh you dark and you bitter tide**  
**If I can't have him by my side**  
**I guess I have to leave him**  

I gave you one, I gave you two  
The best that rotten old boat could do  
You wouldn't be happy till I gave you three  
But I'll be damned if you'll get me  

**Oh the tide, oh the tide,**  
**Oh you dark and you bitter tide**  
**If I can't have him by my side**  
**The water's welcome to him**  

Oh Lord I know that the day will come  
When one less boat comes slogging home  
I don't mind knowing that he'll be the one  
But I can't spend my whole life praying  

I gave you one, I gave you two  
The best that poor old boat could do  
You'd have it all before you're through  
Well I've got no more to give you  
# Wellerman   
The Longest Johns  

**Soon may the Wellerman come**  
**To bring us sugar and tea and rum**  
**One day, when the tonguin' is done**  
**We'll take our leave and go**  

There once was a ship that put to sea  
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea  
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down  
O blow, my bully boys, blow  

She had not been two weeks from shore  
When down on her a right whale bore  
The captain called all hands and swore  
He'd take that whale in tow  

Before the boat had hit the water  
The whale's tail came up and caught her  
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her  
When she dived down below  

No line was cut, no whale was freed;  
The Captain's mind was not of greed  
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;  
She took the ship in tow  

For forty days, or even more  
The line went slack, then tight once more  
All boats were lost (there were only four)  
But still that whale did go  

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on;  
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone  
The Wellerman makes his regular call  
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all  







# Whiskey  
   
Whiskey is the life of man, I’ll drink whiskey when I can   
**Whiskey-o, Johnny-o **  
**Rise her up from down below **  
** **  
**Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey-o **  
**Up aloft this yard must go **  
**John rise her up from down below **  
** **  
I like whiskey hot and strong, I’ll drink whiskey all day long…   
   
I’ll drink it hot, I’ll drink it cold, I’ll drink it new, I’ll drink it old   
   
Whiskey made me sell my coat, whiskey’s what keeps me afloat   
   
Whiskey killed my sister Sue, whiskey killed my brother, too   
   
If whiskey was a river and I was a duck, I'd dive to the bottom and never come up   
   
I wish I knew where whiskey grew, I'd eat the leaves and the branches too   
   
Whiskey made me fail my class, whiskey got me crappy ass   
   
Some likes whiskey, some likes beer, I wish I had a barrel here   
   
Whiskey caused an awkward pause   
   
Whiskey made the bosun call "hang together, one and all"   
   
Whiskey stole my brains away, one more pull and we’ll belay   
   
*[Only the captain or boatswain sings this line!]*  
A glass of grog for every man and a barrel full **for the shantyman**!  

# Whiskey In The Jar  

As I was going over the far-famed Kerry Mountains  
I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was counting  
I first produced my pistol, and then produced my rapier  
Saying "stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver"  

**Musha ring dum a do dum a da**  
**Whack fol the daddy-o, whack fol the daddy-o**  
**There’s whiskey in the jar**  

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny  
I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny  
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me  
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy  

I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber  
I dreamt of gold and jewels, and sure it was no wonder  
That Jenny took my changes and she filled them up with water  
And sent for Captain Farrell to make ready for the slaughter  

T’was early in the morning, afore I rose to travel  
Up comes a band of footmen, and likewise Captain Farrell  
I first produced my pistol for she’d stolen away my rapier  
But I couldn’t shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken  

Well they threw me in the jail, said the years I would be counting  
For robbing Captain Farrell in the far-famed Kerry Mountains  
But they didn’t take me fists so I knocked the jailer down  
And I bid a fond farewell to that jail in Liverpool town  

If anyone can aid me it’s my brother in the army  
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney  
And if he’ll go with me we’ll go roving in Kilkenny  
I’m sure he’ll treat me better than my own disporting Jenny  

There’s some take delight in the hurling and the bowling  
And some take delight in the carriages a-rolling  
But I take delight in the juice of the barley  
And courting pretty, fair maids in the morning bright and early  

# Whiskey You’re The Devil  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

Now brave boys we’re on for marching  
Off to Portugal or Spain  
The drums are beating, banners flying  
The devil at home will come tonight  
Love, fair thee well  

**With me tiddlee aye dul do dul dum a dah**  
**Me tiddlee aye dul do dul dum a dah**  
**Me rightful toora laddie**  
**Oh, there’s whiskey in the jar**  

**Oh, whiskey, you’re the devil, you’re leading me astray**  
**Over hills and mountains, and to a merry quay**  
**You’re sweet, you’re strong, you’re decent**  
**Oh, you’re spunkier than tay**  
**Oh, whiskey, you’re me darling drunk or sober**  

Said the mother, "do not wrong me,  
Don’t take me daughter from me  
For if you do I will torment you  
And after that me ghost will haunt you"  
Love, fair thee well  

Oh, the French are fighting boldly  
Men are dying hot and cowardly  
Give every man his flash and powder  
His firelock on his shoulder  
Love, fare thee well  


# Wild Mountain Thyme  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

Oh, the summertime is coming  
And the trees, they are a-blooming  
And the wild mountain thyme   
Grows among the blooming heather  

**Will ye go, lassie, go**  
**And we’ll all go together**  
**To pick wild mountain thyme**  
**All around the blooming heather**  
**Will ye go, lassie, go**  

I will build my love a bower  
By yon pure and crystal fountain  
And around it I will pile  
All the flowers of the mountain  

If me love should ever leave me  
I will surely find anotherb  
Where the wild mountain thyme  
Grows around the blooming heather  

# Wild Rover  
Formerly in the Irish Packet  

I've played the Wild Rover for many a year  
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer  
But now I'm returning with gold in great store  
And I never will play the Wild Rover no more.  

**And it's no, nay, never ***[hike up your kilt]*  
**No nay never no more**  
**Will I play the Wild Rover**  
**No never, no more.**  

I went to an alehouse I used to frequent  
And I told the landlady me money was spent  
I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay,"  
"Such custom as yours I could have any day!"  

I took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright  
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight  
She said, "I have whiskeys, and wines of the best,  
And the words that I told you was only in jest!"  

I’ll return to my parents, confess what I’ve done  
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son  
And when they forgive me, as oft' times before  
Then I never will play the Wild Rover no more.
