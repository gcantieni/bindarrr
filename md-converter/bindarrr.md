# A-Rovin’ {#a-rovin’}

In Amsterdam there lived a maid  
Mark well what I do say   
In Amsterdam there lived a maid   
And she was mistress of her trade   
**I’ll go no more a-rovin’ with you, fair maid** 

**A-rovin’, a-rovin’, since rovin’s been my ru-i-n**   
**I’ll go no more a-rovin’ with you, fair maid** 

Her lips were red her eyes were brown…   
Her hair was black and hanging down… 

These last ten months I’d been to sea   
And Hell, this gal looked good to me 

I took this maid out for a walk   
And we had such a lovely talk 

And on this walk on which we went  
She clearly gave me her consent 

I took her hand within my own   
Said she, “It’s time that I was home” 

I put my hand upon her knee   
Said she, “Young man, you’re rather free” 

I put my hand around her waist   
Said she, “Young man, you’re in great haste” 

I put my hand upon her thigh   
Said she, “Young man, you’re rather high” 

I put my hand upon her breast   
We did the dance she does the best 

But when me money all was spent   
’Twas off to sea I gladly went 

# Adieu, Sweet Lovely Nancy {#adieu,-sweet-lovely-nancy}

Adieu, sweet lovely Nancy, ten thousand times adieu  
I’m going across the ocean, love, to seek for something new.  
Come change your ring with me, dear girl, come change your ring with me  
That it might be a token of true love while I am on the sea. 

And when I am across the sea, you’ll know not where I am.  
Kind letters I will write to you from every foreign land.  
The secrets of your heart, dear girl, are the best of my good will,  
And let my body be where it might, my heart is with you still.

There’s a heavy storm a-rising; see how it gathers ‘round  
While we poor souls on the ocean wide are fighting for the crown.  
Our officers commanding us and them we must obey  
Expecting every moment for to get cast away.[^1]

There are tinkers, tailors, and shoemakers, lie snoring fast asleep  
While we poor souls on the ocean wide are plowing up the deep.  
There’s nothing to protect us, love, or to keep us from the cold  
On the ocean wide where we must bide, like jolly seamen bold.

But when these wars are over there’ll be peace on every shore.  
We’ll return to our wives and our families and the girls that we adore.  
We’ll call for liquor merrily and we’ll spend our money free,  
And when our money it is all gone, we will boldly go to sea.

# Agamemnon {#agamemnon}

## *From Corvis the Nightterror*

Where is Henry Adams now, that planned the Agamemnon?  
Foundered on the River Plate, in Maldonaldos Bay.  
**Oak and iron blood of her, his fine one, his darling,**  
**Sink him in his hammock, boys, he’s gone far away\!**

Where are all the Beaulieu boys, that built the Agamemnon?  
Let them lie ’neath waving grass, contented where they lay.  
**Swords and swinging riveters, their sounds will not be waking them,**  
**Sink them in their hammocks, boys, they’ve gone far away\!**

Where is Captain Nelson now, that sailed the Agamemnon?  
Fought and beat the Spanish crews in Cape St Vincent Bay —  
**Oak and iron blood of her, his fine one, his darling,—**  
**Broach the keg of brandy, boys, and send him far away\!**

Where are all the jolly tars, that crewed the Agamemnon?  
Men for whom the carronades were less hard work than play.  
**Oak and iron blood were they, and every girl a darling,**  
**Sink them in their hammocks, lads, they’ve gone far away\!**

Sing the shanty loud, my boys, we’ll rouse the Agamemnon\!  
Stamp it round her capstan and her anchor we will weigh.  
**Where are all the wooden walls, the cloud of sails a-bearing,**  
**They’re foundered, sunk or broken, and they’ve gone far away\!**

Where is Henry Adams now, that planned the Agamemnon?  
Foundered on the River Plate, in Maldonaldos Bay.  
**Oak and iron blood of her, his fine one, his darling,**  
**Sink him in his hammock, boys, he’s gone far away\!**

# All For Me Grog {#all-for-me-grog}

It’s all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog   
It’s all gone for beer and tobacco   
Well I spent all me tin on the lassies drinking gin   
And across the western ocean I must wander 

Where is me shirt, me noggy noggy shirt? / It’s…   
The collar’s all worn out and the front is kicked about   
And my tails are looking out for better weather   
   
Where are me boots, me noggy noggy boots?   
They’ve all gone for beer and tobacco   
The leather’s all worn out and the soles are all worn out   
And my toes are looking out for better weather   
    
Where is me bed, me noggy noggy bed? / It’s…   
I loant it to a whore and now it’s all a-wore   
And the springs are looking out for better weather   
   
Where is me wench, me noggy noggy wench? / She’s…   
Her lips is all worn out and her front is kicked about   
And her tail is looking out for better weather   
   
Where is me man, me noggy noggy man? / He’s…   
Well he spends all his time with the women and the wine   
So I think that I shall push him over yonder   
   
Where is me whore, me noggy noggy whore? / She’s…   
It’s her I want to lay, but she says I cannot pay   
So my whore is looking out for richer sailors   
   
It’s all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog   
It’s all gone for beer and tobacco   
Well I spent all me loot in a house of ill repute   
And I think that I shall go back there tomorrow   
   
Well I’m sick in the head, and I haven’t been to bed,   
Since first I came ashore with me plunder,   
I’ve seen centipedes and snakes, and I’m full of pains and aches,   
And I think that I shall push out over yonder   
   
Well me money was a-spent, and so off to see we went,   
And the ocean looked like whiskey, ‘twas an omen,   
Well we set off for Cathay, but we washed up far away,   
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond

# Amble Town (Home Dearie Home) {#amble-town-(home-dearie-home)}

## *Recorded by Ed Trickett*

O Amble is a fine town with ships about the bay  
It's fain and very fain to be there myself today  
I'm wishing in my heart I was far away from here  
Sitting in my parlor and talking with my dear

**And it's home, dearie, home, it's home I want to be**  
**My topsails are hoisted and I am out to sea**  
**The oak and the ash and the bonnie birchen tree**  
**Are all a-growing green in the North country**  
**And it's home, dearie, home**

A letter came today, but somehow I cannot speak  
And the proud and happy tears are a-rolling down my cheeks  
There's someone here, she says, you've been waiting for to see  
With your merry hazel eyes, looking up from off my knee

But the letter never said if we have a boy or girl  
Got me so confused that my heart is all a whirl  
So I'm going back to port, where I'll quickly turn around  
And take the fastest ship, which to Ambletown is bound

Well, if it be a girl, she shall wear a golden ring  
If it be a boy, he shall live to serve the King  
With his buckles and his boot and his little jacket blue  
He'll walk the quarterdeck, like his daddy used to do

# Anderson’s Coast {#anderson’s-coast}

## *From Barefoot the Bootless*

Old Bass Strait roars like some great millrace,  
**And where are you, my Annie?**  
And the same moon shines on this lonely place,  
As shone one day on my Annie’s face.

**But Annie, dear, don’t wait for me,**  
**I fear I shall not return to thee,**  
**There’s nought to do but endure my fate,**  
**And watch the moon, the lonely moon**  
**Light the breakers on wild Bass Strait.**

We stole a vessel and all her gear,  
And from Van Dieman’s we north did steer,  
Till Bass Strait’s wild waves wrecked us here.

A mile inland as our path was laid  
We found a government stockade  
Long deserted but stoutly made

And somewhere west, Port Melbourne lies,  
Through swamps infested with snakes and flies,  
The fool who walks there, he surely dies.

We hail no ships though the time, it drags,  
Our chain gang walk and our government rags  
All mark us out as Van Dieman’s lags.

We fled the lash and the chafing chain,  
We fled hard labor and brutal pain,  
And here we are, and here remain.

# Auld Triangle {#auld-triangle}

A hungry feeling came o'er me stealing   
And the mice were squealing in my prison cell 

**And the old triangle went jingle jangle**   
**All along the banks of the royal canal**

To begin the morning the screw was bawling   
"Get up, ya rascal, and clean up your cell" 

The screw was peeping, Humpy Gussy was sleeping   
As I lay there dreaming of my girl, Sal 

Up in the female prison there are seventy-five women   
And 'tis among them I wish I did dwell

# 

# The Ball Of Kerrymuir {#the-ball-of-kerrymuir}

Four and twenty virgins came down from Inverness  
And when the ball was over there were four and twenty less\!

**Singing balls to your partner; your ass against the wall**  
**If you’ve never been had on a Saturday night, you’ve never been had at all.**

There was doin’ in the parlor, and doin’ on the stones  
You couldn’t hear the music for the wheezin’ and the moans

The village economist he was there, his prick held in his hand  
Waitin’ for the moment when supply would meet demand

The village postman he was there, but the poor man had the pox  
He couldn’t do the lassies, so he did the letter box 

Anne Boleyn was also there, even though she’s dead  
She’s terrific on her back, me boys, but better giving head\!

Pinocchio was also there, and quite a sight to see  
The ladies sat upon his face and shouted, “Lie to me\!”

The village magician, he was there; he gave us all a laugh  
He pulled his foreskin over his head and vanished up his ass\!

# The Ballad Of Captain Kidd {#the-ballad-of-captain-kidd}

My name is Captain Kidd **as I sailed, as I sailed**  
**My name is Captain Kidd as I sailed.**  
**My name is Captain Kidd**, and wickedly I did  
And wickedly I did **as I sailed, as I sailed**  
**And wickedly I did as I sailed.**

My parents taught me well…  
**My parents taught me** **well** to shun the gates of Hell  
But against them I rebelled…

I’d a Bible in my hand…  
**I’d a Bible in my hand;** I sunk it in the sand  
Before I left the strand…

I spied three ships of Spain…  
**I spied three ships of Spain**; I fired on them the main  
‘Til all three crew was slain…

I’d eighty bars of gold…  
**I’d eighty bars of gold** and dollars in the hold  
And riches uncontrolled…

I murdered William Moore…  
**I murdered William Moore** and left him in his gore  
Full forty leagues from shore…

O’ertaken now at last…  
**O’ertaken now at last** and into prison cast  
And sentence being passed…

To execution dock **I must go, I must go**  
**To execution dock I must go**  
**To execution dock** while thousands ‘round me flock  
To see me on the block **as I go, as I go**  
**To see me on the block as I go**.

**They called me Captain Kidd as I sailed, as I sailed.**  
**They called me Captain Kidd, and wickedly I did**  
**And wickedly I did as I sailed, as I sailed.**

# Barrett's Privateers  {#barrett's-privateers}

## *Stan Rogers*

Oh, the year was 1778   
**How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now**   
A letter of marque came from the king   
To the scummiest vessel I’d ever seen 

**God damn them all\!**   
**I was told we’d cruise the seas for American gold**   
**We’d fire no guns, shed no tears**   
**Now I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier**   
**The last of Barrett’s privateers** 

Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town…   
For twenty brave men, all fishermen who   
Would make for him the Antelope’s crew 

The Antelope’s sloop was a sickening sight...  
She’d a list to the port and her sails in rags   
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags 

On the King’s birthday we put to sea...  
We were ninety-one days to Montego Bay   
Pumping like madmen all the way 

On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again...  
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight   
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight 

The Yankee lay low down with gold...  
She was broad and fat and loose in stays   
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days 

Then at length we stood two cables away...  
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din   
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in 

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side...  
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs   
And the main truck carried off both me legs 

So here I lay in my twenty-third year...  
It’s been six years since we sailed away   
And I just made Halifax yesterday

# Ben Backstay {#ben-backstay}

Ben Backstay was our boatswain, a very merry boy  
For no one half so merrily, could pipe all hands ahoy  
And when unto his summons, we did not well attend  
No lad than he more merrily, could handle the rope’s end  
**Could han-dle the rope’s end, could han-dle the rope’s end**

**Singing chip chow cherry chow fol de riddle idle ow**  
**Chip chow cherry chow fol de riddle day (x2)**

While sailing once our Captain, who was a jolly dog  
Served out to all our company, a double share of grog  
Ben Backstay he got tipsy, all to his heart’s content  
And he being half seas over, boys, right overboard he went  
**Right o-ver-board he went, right o-ver-board he went**

A shark was on the starboard bow, and sharks no man can stand  
For they do grapple everything, just like your sharks on land  
We heaved Ben out some tackling, to give his life some hope  
But as the shark bit his head off, so he couldn't see the rope  
**So he could-n’t see the rope, he could-n’t see the rope**

Without his head his ghost appeared, all on the briny lake  
He piped all hands ahoy and cried, "Lads warning by me take  
By drinking grog I lost my life, and you my fate could meet  
So never mix your rum me lads, but always take them neat  
**But al-ways take them neat, but al-ways take them neat**

# The Bergen {#the-bergen}

## *Jez Lowe*

Sleep, why’d you wake me with these dreams you bring?  
**Dreams came to me where I lay**  
And deep the melodies the wild waves sing  
**My love is far, far away**

**Oh, pity the hearts**  
**The wild waves part**  
**My love sails the bonny barque**  
**The Bergen**

They heap their nets upon the decks by light  
And creep out gentle in the dead of night

They reap their harvest from the cold night sea  
It leaps with herring ‘neath his decks for me

Steep waves rise above his cold, fair head  
Oh keep him safe to lie here in my bed\!

It weeps with rain tonight where my love lies  
It sweeps the foreign sands from out his eyes

# The Black Ball Line {#the-black-ball-line}

## *From Barefoot the Bootless*

I served me time in the black ball line  
**To me way hey hey hurrahdo**  
In the black ball line I served me time  
**Hurrah for the black ball line**

The black ball ships they are good and true  
They are the ships for me and you

Once there was a black ball ship  
That fourteen knots an hour could clip

You will surely find a rush gold mine  
Just take a trip on the black ball line

Just take a trip to liverpool  
To Liverpool that yankee school

The yankee sailors you’ll see there  
With red topped boots and short cut hair

# Black Is The Color Of My True Love’s Hair {#black-is-the-color-of-my-true-love’s-hair}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

Black is the color of my true love's hair  
Her lips are red like some roses fair  
The purest eyes and the gentlest hands  
I love the ground whereon she stands

I go to Clyde for to mourn and weep  
But satisfied I never can sleep  
I'll write to you in a few short lines  
I'll suffer death ten thousand times

I love my love and well she knows  
I love the grass whereon she goes  
If she on earth no more I see  
My life will quickly fade away from me

Her lips are like some roses fair  
The purest eyes and the gentlest hands

# Black Velvet Band {#black-velvet-band}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

In a neat little town they call Belfast  
Apprenticed to trade I was bound  
And many an hour’s sweet happiness  
I spent in that neat little town  
’Til sad misfortune befell me  
And caused me to stray from the land  
Far away from my friends and relations  
To follow the black velvet band

**Her eyes they shone like the diamonds**  
**You’d think she was queen of the land**  
**And her hair hung over her shoulder**  
**Tied up with a black velvet band**

When I was out strolling one evening  
Not meaning to go very far  
When I met with a frolicsome damsel  
She was plying her trade in a bar  
When a watch she took from a customer  
And slipped it right into my hand  
Then the law came and put me in prison  
Bad luck to the Black Velvet Band

Next morning before judge and jury  
At trial I had to appear  
The judge says to me, “me young fellow  
The case against you is quite clear  
And seven long years is your sentence  
You’re going to Van Diemen’s Land  
Far away from your friends and relations  
To follow the black velvet band”

So come all you jolly young fellows  
I’ll have you take warning by me  
Whenever you’re out on the liquor, me boys  
Beware of the pretty colleens  
They’ll fill you with whiskey and porter  
’Til you are not able to stand  
And the very next thing that you know, me lads  
You’ve landed in Van Diemen’s Land

# Blackthorn {#blackthorn}

## *By Splinter-Eye*

**Blackthorn, carry me home,**  
**For it's down the hedgerows I will travel.**  
**Blackened skin and poison thorns,**  
**Blackthorn, carry me home.**  
**Oh, blackthorn, carry me home.**

I went on the back roads and there did see  
There did see a rosary,  
A poor old mother on her hands and knees.  
Blackthorn, carry me home.

She wept on the ground where the bright sun shone.  
The bright sun shone, on and on.  
"I had three children, they are dead and gone."  
Blackthorn, carry me home.

I cut a branch of the poison thorns,  
Poison thorns like the devil's horns,  
A staff for to carry me 'til the morn.  
Blackthorn, carry me home.

# Blood Red Roses {#blood-red-roses}

Our boots and shoes are all in pawn   
**Go down, you blood red roses, go down**   
It’s flaming drafty ’round Cape Horn   
**Go down, you blood red roses, go down**   
   
**Ah, you pinks and posies**   
**Go down, you blood red roses, go down**   
   
It’s ’round Cape Horn with frozen sail…   
Around Cape Stiff to hunt for whale…   
   
It’s ’round Cape Horn the ship must go   
For that is where them whalefishes blow   
   
It’s growl you may but go you must   
You growl too hard your head they’ll bust   
   
Rock and shake her is the cry   
The bleeding topmast sheave is dry   
   
Just one more pull and that will do   
For we’re the crew to kick her through

# Blow The Man Down  {#blow-the-man-down}

As I was a-walkin’ down Paradise Street   
*(To me\!)* **Way, hey, blow the man down**   
A pretty young damsel I chanced for to meet   
**Give me some time to blow the man down** 

She was round in the corner and bluff in the bow…   
So I took in all sail and cried “Way enough now”… 

I threw out my hawser and took her in tow   
And yardarm to yardarm away did we go 

She said to me “Sir, will you stand for the treat?”   
“Delighted,” says I, “for a charmer so sweet” 

It was up in her quarters she piped me aboard   
And there on her bed I cut loose with my sword 

But just as my cutter was forging ahead   
She shouted “My husband\!” and jumped out of bed 

He was seven feet tall, had a chest like a horse   
And right for my jawbone he plotted his course 

He loosened my rigging, he kicked me in stays   
I flew down the stairs like a ship on the way 

I chanced on a packet that happened on by   
And when I awoke I was bound for Shanghai 

So I’ll give you fair warning before we belay   
Don’t ever take heed of what pretty girls say

# Blow Ye Winds In The Morning {#blow-ye-winds-in-the-morning}

‘Tis advertised in Boston, New York and Buffalo  
Five hundred brave Americans, A-whaling for to go, singing

**Blow, ye winds in the morning, blow, ye winds, high-ho\!**  
**Clear away your running gear, and blow, boys, blow\!**

They send you to New Bedord, that famous whaling port,  
And give you to some land-sharks to board and fit you out.

They send you to a boarding-house, there for a time to dwell;  
The thieves they there are thicker than the other side of hell\!

It's now we're out to sea, my boys, the wind comes on to blow;  
One half the watch is sick on deck, the other half below.

The cooper's at the vise-bench, a-making iron poles,  
And the mate's upon the main hatch a-cursing all our souls.

The Skipper's on the quarter-deck a-squinting at the sails,  
When up aloft the lookout sights a mighty school of whales.

Now we have got him turned up, we tow him alongside;  
We over with our blubber-hooks and rob him of his hide.

But now that our old ship is full and we don't give a damn,  
We'll bend on all our stu'nsails and sail for Yankee land.

When we get home, our ship made fast, and we get through our sailing,  
A winding glass around we'll pass and damn this blubber whaling\!

# The Boatman’s Cure {#the-boatman’s-cure}

## *From Long-Hard Susan*

Poling up the **river** in a three-hand boat,  
Too deep to carry, too shallow to float,  
Too deep to carry, too shallow to float.  
     **If it doesn't lift your spirits it'll leave you numb**  
     **Best cure for the river is a bottle of rum,**  
     **Best cure for the river is a bottle of rum.**

Listen to the **forwarder** struttin' on the quay,  
He's quick to tell the boatman how the river will be.

Workin' up the rift the current swung her round,  
**Bedbugs** swum ashore, poor boatman nearly got drowned.  
      
Sweatin' in the heat of day, chillin' in the rain,  
Sleepin' in the open got the **ague** again.  
       
Frostbite in November took my toes away,  
Devil take the **blackfly** 'bout the last week in May.

Sweet Annie from Schenectady, she broke my heart, **(heartbreak)**  
Her face is in the firelight, the river sings her part.

I fought all through this wilderness in '59  
Still fancy I see **shadows** moving most of the time.  
      
Morning comes up early for a fast bateau,  
Shoulder to the setting pole, you push off and go.  
     **But there ain't no cure for living in a bottle of rum**.

# Bold Privateer {#bold-privateer}

Oh my dearest Molly, it's you and I must part  
I'm across the ocean, love \- I'll leave you with my heart  
My ship is now awaiting, so fare thee well my dear  
I'm going onboard the vessel a bold privateer

**Bold privateer, bold privateer**  
**I'm just now going onboard the bold privateer**

Oh my dearest Johnny, great dangers have been wrought,  
And many's a sweet life on the sea has been lost  
Better stay at home with your charming Molly dear  
Then to venture your sweet life a bold privateer

**Bold privateer, bold privateer**  
**Then to venture your sweet life a bold privateer**

Oh my dearest Molly, your friends do me despise,  
Besides you have two brothers who'd freely take my life  
Come change your ring with me, dear love, come change your ring with me,  
And let it be a token when I'm across the sea

**When I'm across the sea, when I'm across the sea**  
**And let it be a token when I'm across the sea.**

And when the war is ended, should heaven spare my life  
I'll return again to my intended wife  
And then I'll get married to my charming Molly dear  
And forever bid adieu to the bold privateer

**Bold privateer, bold privateer**  
**And forever bid adieu to the bold privateer.**

# Bones in the Ocean {#bones-in-the-ocean}

## *The Longest Johns*

Oh, I bid farewell to the port and the land  
And I paddle away from New England's white sands  
To search for my long ago forgotten friends  
To search for the place I hear all sailors end

**As the souls of the dead fill the space of my mind**  
**I'll search without sleeping 'til peace I can find**  
**I fear not the weather, I fear not the sea**  
**I remember the fallen, do they think of me?**  
**When their bones in the ocean forever will be**

Plot a course to the night, to a place I once knew  
To a place where my hope died along with my crew  
So I swallow my grief and face life's final test  
To find promise of peace and the solace of rest

**As the souls of the dead fill the space of my ears**  
**Their laughter like children, their beckoning cheers**  
**My heart longs to join them, sing songs of the sea**  
**I remember the fallen, do they think of me?**  
**When their bones in the ocean forever will be**

When at last before my ghostly shipmates I stand  
I shed a small tear for my home upon land  
Though their eyes speak of deaths filled with struggle and strife  
Their smiles below say I don't owe them my life

**As the souls of the dead fill the space of my eyes**  
**And my boat listed over and tried to capsize**  
**I'm this far from drowning, this far from the sea**  
**I remember the living, do they think of me?**  
**When my bones in the ocean forever will be**

Now that I'm staring down at the darkest abyss  
I'm not sure what I want, but I don't think it's this  
As my comrades call to stand fast and forge on  
I make sail for the dawn 'til the darkness has gone

**As the souls of the dead live fore'er in my mind**  
**As I live all the years that they left me behind**  
**I'll stay on the shore but still gaze at the sea**  
**I remember the fallen and they think of me**  
**For our souls in the ocean together will be**

# The Bonnie Ship the Diamond {#the-bonnie-ship-the-diamond}

## *Transcribed by Meister Jaeger from The Watersons (1965)*

The Diamond is a ship, me lads, for the Davis Strait she’s bound  
And the quay it is all garnished with the bonnie lassies round  
Captain Thompson gives the orders to sail the whole world wide  
Where the sun it never sets, me lads, nor darkness dims the sky

**And it’s cheer up, me lads, let your hearts never fail**  
**For the bonnie ship the Diamond goes a-fishin’ for the whale**

Along the quay at Peterhead where the lassies stand around  
With their shawls all pulled about them and the salt tears running down  
Now don’t you weep my bonnie lass, though we leave you behind  
For the rose will grow on Greenland’s banks before we change our mind

Here’s a health to the *Resolution*, likewise the *Eliza Swan*  
Here’s a health to the *Battler of the Montrose[^2]* and the *Diamond*, ship of fame[^3]  
We wear the trousers of the white and the jackets of the blue  
When we come home to Peterhead, we’ll have sweethearts in you

It will be bright both day and night when the Greenland lads come home  
With a ship that’s full of oil, me lads, and money of our own  
We’ll make the cradles for to rock and the blankets for to tear  
And every lass in Peterhead sings “Hushabye, my dear”

# Boozing {#boozing}

Now what are the joys of a single young man?   
**Why, boozing, bloody well boozing**   
And what is he doing whenever he can?   
**Why, boozing, bloody well boozing** 

You may think I’m wrong or you may think I’m right   
I’m not going to argue, I know you can’t fight   
But what do you think we are doing tonight?   
**Why, boozing, bloody well boozing** 

**Boozing, boozing, just you and I**   
**Boozing, boozing, when we are dry**   
**Some do it openly, some on the sly**   
**And we all are bloody well boozing** 

Oh what are the joys of an old married man? **…**   
And what is he doing whenever he can? **…**   
He comes home at night and he gives his wife all   
He goes out a-shopping, makes many a call   
But what brings him home hanging on to the wall? **…** 

And what do the moral majority run down? **…**   
And what are they banning in every town? **…**   
They stand on street corners, they rave and they shout   
They shout about things they know nothing about   
But what are they doing when the lights are turned out? **…**

# Bound for Amerikay {#bound-for-amerikay}

## *Paul Lauzon, from Albatrossity*

 

Come all ye and listen to a tale that is true  
The Liverpool paper said, “Men we need you  
Young men and strong come sign up today  
In the morning we’re bound for Amerikay”  
   
So I says to the captain Mr. Plato Denney,  
“Sir, I crave to be free of this poverty”  
He said, “Sign here young man, come give us a hand  
In seven short years[^4] you will own your own land”  
   
**Chorus:**  
**Hey boys, won’t you sing us a song**  
**Hey boys, to last the whole night long**  
**Ah love, don’t you turn me away**  
**In the morning I’m bound for Amerikay**  
   
We set sail from Liverpool across the wide sea  
In April of seventeen hundred and seventy  
Thirty-eight men, no children, no wives  
Bound for the new world to make new lives  
   
Hail, sleet and rain, a confused angry sea  
With close smelling quarters – you had to fight just to breathe  
Weary and wasted sailors we were  
Eating salt beef and biscuits with water and vinegar  
   
**Chorus**  
   
In summer we landed on Campobell’ Isle  
And they put us to work in a very short while  
Building houses and barns, planting turnips and grain  
And fishing for cod in the wind and the rain  
   
Oh, the masters were hard as my calluses showed  
It was us made them rich but still debts we owed  
We’d work from the dust to the late setting sun  
But at night we’d forget with our spruce beer and rum  
   
**Chorus**  
   
In seventeen hundred and seventy two  
We ambushed the captain and told him we were through  
Of slaving for nothing in a land not our own  
And at gunpoint we told him you’re taking us back home  
   
We set sail for Liverpool, ‘twas late in the year  
Each role of the ship, we let out a cheer  
Free men at last, ourselves in command  
But our good ship went down just after Newfoundland  
   
**Chorus**

# Bound for Valparaiso in a Rowboat {#bound-for-valparaiso-in-a-rowboat}

## *Zeke Hoskin*

Windsor is a lovely port we're proud to sing about  
There's a warehouse full of whisky, though the Yankees do without  
And when Customs asks us where we're bound, we ship our oars and shout:  
"We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat"

**Pull your oars\! *Pull your oars\!* We're on our way\! *We're on our way\!***  
**With a thousand quarts of whisky bound for Valparaiso Bay**  
**And we haven't no intention for to see the U.S.A.**  
**We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat**

Some say that for an ocean trip our craft is very small  
But we bold Canadian lads don't fear a little Cape Horn squall  
And a deep sea schooner's just too big to shoot Niagara Falls  
We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat

We've sailed for Valparaiso twenty seven times this week  
But every time we've gotten to the mouth of Muddy Creek  
We've had to jettison our cargo 'cause the oarlock sprung a leak  
We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat

Now some sing of Vancouver, of St John and Halifax  
But those salty water cities, they have nothing Windsor lacks  
We've a dory load of whisky and the muscles in our backs  
We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat

**Hey rig a jig in the low back car**  
**Ra hey ra ho are you most done**  
**Liza Lee all on my knee**  
**Clear away the track and let the bullgine run**

Well Eliza Lee if you were mine  
I would dress you up in silk so fine

Well the prettiest sight you'll ever see  
Is Eliza Lee all on my knee

Well in Liverpool town them girls hang 'round  
And it’s there Eliza can be found

And when we get to Liverpool town  
I will stand you whiskey all around

Well when I come home from across the sea  
Oh, Eliza Lee will you marry me?

Well I'll stay with you upon the shore  
And it's back to sea I'll go no more

Well, Sally is the girl that I love dearly   
**Way, hey, bully in the alley**   
Sally is the girl that I’d splice nearly   
**Bully down in Shinbone Al’** 

For seven long years I courted Sally…   
All she did was dilly in the dally… 

I bought her silks, I bought her laces   
I took her out to all the fine places 

Well, I’ll leave Sal and I’ll be a sailor   
I’ll leave Sal and ship aboard a whaler 

When I get back I’ll marry Sally   
We’ll have kids and count them by the tally

Cape Cod moms don’t bake no pies  
They feed their children codfish eyes

Cape Cod cats don’t got no tails  
They lost them all in Cape Cod gales

Cape Cod dogs don’t got no bite  
They lost it barking at the Cape Cod light

Cape Cod doctors got no pills

Cape Cod ladies don’t give no thrills  
They’re plain and skinny as the codfish gills

**You're two days nearer death**  
**But you go...**

Well a Process Man am I and I'm tellin' you no lie  
I work and breathe among the fumes that trail across the sky  
There's thunder all around me and there's poison in the air  
There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair

Well, I've worked among the spinners and I breathe the oily smoke  
I've shoveled up the gypsum and it nigh on makes you choke  
I've stood knee deep in cyanide, got sick with a caustic burn  
Been working rough, I've seen enough to make your stomach turn

There's overtime and bonus opportunities galore  
The young men like their money and they all come back for more  
But soon you're knocking on and you look older than you should  
For every bob made on the job, you pay with flesh and blood

Well a Process Man am I, and I'm telling you no lie  
I work and breathe among the fumes that trail across the sky  
There's thunder all around me and there's poison in the air  
There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair

Well back up your topsails

For we have got some letters  
To be carried home by you...

We'll back up our topsails  
And heave our vessel to...  
But only in some harbour  
And along the side of you...

For broadside for broadside  
We fought all on the main...  
Until at last the pirate  
Shot the frigate's mast away...

“For quarters\! For quarters\!”  
The saucy sailors cried...  
The quarters that we showed them  
Was to sink them in the tide...

With cutlass and gun  
Oh, we fought for hours three...  
Their ship it was their coffin,  
And their grave it was the sea...

In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty  
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone  
As she wheeled her wheel-barrow

**Through streets broad and narrow**  
**Crying “cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o\!”**  
**Alive, alive-o, alive, alive-o\!**  
**Crying “cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o\!”**

She was a fishmonger, but sure 'twas no wonder  
For so were her father and mother before  
And they each wheeled their barrow  
**Through…**

She died of a faver, and no one could save her  
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone  
But her ghost wheels her barrow  
**Through…**

**I’m a collier lad, working down the mine**   
   
It’s Saint Monday’s day, and well I do admire   
To sit snug at home by my own coal fire   
Then it’s down to the pub for a pint or two   
For to work on Monday, that would never do   
   
Now my son’s fourteen, he’s a strapping lad   
He’ll go down to the mine just like his dad   
And when Friday comes we’ll pick up our pay   
And we’ll drink together to round out the day   
   
Well, I likes me whiskey and I likes me beer   
I’ll drink fourteen pints and I’ll not feel queer   
I can hold my liquor as well as any man   
And I’ll dance and sing as long as I can   
   
And it’s when I die then I know full well

I wrote me love a letter; I was on the Jenny Lind

My love wrote me a letter as I sailed the great blue sea   
My love wrote me a letter she won't wait at home for me

# Congo River[^5] {#congo-river}

Was you ever on the Congo River?  
**Blow, boys, blow**  
Where fever makes the sailor shiver  
**Blow me bully boys, blow**

A Yankee ship came down the river  
Her masts and yards they shone like silver…

How d’you know she’s a Yankee clipper?  
By the blood an’ guts that flow from her scuppers

Yonder came the Arrow packet  
She fired her guns an’ I heard the racket 

And who do you think was the skipper of her?  
It’s old Bully Hayes; he’s a sailor robber

And who do you think was chief mate of her?  
Why Boss-eyed Bill the Bowery Bastard

And what do you think that they had for breakfast?  
The starboard side of an old sou’wester

And what do you think that they had for dinner?  
A monkey’s heart and a donkey’s liver

And what do you think that they had for supper?  
Belaying pin pie and a roll in the scupper

Blow today and blow tomorrow  
And blow me from this ship of sorrow

Blow today and blow forever  
And blow me down the Congo River

# The Crawl {#the-crawl}

## *(from Sir Chauncey Bonnet, Esq.)*

**Well, we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,**  
**Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;**  
**And this night, by God\! We drank till there was no more,**  
**From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between.**

It all began one afternoon on the shores of Ambleside,  
We were sittin' there quite peacefully with the rising of the tide;  
When an idea it came to mind for to usher in the Fall,  
So we all agreed next Friday night we'd go out on the crawl.

We planned to have a gay old time, the cash we did not spare,  
We left all the cars at home and paid the taxi fare;  
I got out to Horseshoe Bay a little after five,  
From a table in the corner I heard familiar voices rise.

Spirits they ran high that night, old stories we did share,  
Of the days when we were younger men and never had a care;  
The beer flowed like a river and we drank the keg near dry,  
So we drained down all our glasses and were thirsty by-and-by.

Park Royal Hotel, The Rusty Gull, Square-Rigger and Queen's Cross,  
We'd started out with eight good boys but half had gotten lost;  
For you'll never keep the lads together when their eyes begin to rove,  
So there was just the three of us that made it to Deep Cove.

We arrived out at The Raven just in time for the last call,  
The final destination of this the first annual crawl;  
We dug deep into our pockets there was no money to be found,  
Nine miles home and for walking we are bound.

# The Crayfish {#the-crayfish}

"Fisherman, fisherman, standing by the sea,  
Have you a crayfish that you can sell to me?"  
**By the wayside i-diddle-i-doh.**

"Yes sir, yes sir, that indeed I do.  
I've got a crayfish that I can sell to you."

Well, I took him on home and I thought he'd like a swim,  
So I filled up the thunderjug and I threw the bugger in.

Late that night I thought I'd have a fit  
When my old lady got up to *wash her face*.

"Husband, husband," she cried out to me,  
"The devil's in the thunderjug and he's got hold of me\!"

"Children, children, bring the looking glass.  
Come and see the crayfish that bit your mother's *a-face*”

That's the end of my song and there isn’t anymore.  
I’ve an apple in me pocket and you can have the core.

( *alternate: )*  
*That's the end of my song and I don't give a fuck.*  
*There's a lemon up my asshole and you can have a suck.*

# Danny Boy {#danny-boy}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen, and down the mountainside.  
The summer's gone, and all the leaves are falling.  
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,  
For I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow.  
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so.

But if you come, and all the flowers are dying  
And if I'm dead, as dead I well may be.  
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.  
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,  
And o'er my grave shall warmer, sweeter be,  
And if you bend and tell me that you love me,  
Then I shall sleep in peace until you come to me.

# Oh, Dear Grog {#oh,-dear-grog}

   
It’s of dear grog to you I’ll sing,   
And to dear grog I’ll always cling,   
I like my cup filled to the brim,    
And I’ll drink all you’d like to bring.   
   
**And it’s oh, dear grog, thou art my darling,**   
**And my joy both night and morning.**   
   
If all the rest of Adam’s race   
Was assembled in this place,   
I’d part with all without one tear   
Before I’d part with you, my dear   
   
The brewer brewed thee in his pan,   
The tapster drew thee in his can,   
Now I with thee will play my part,   
And lodge thee ever near my heart   
   
And if my wife should me despise,   
By Jove, I’d pluck out both her eyes,   
But if she loved me as I love thee,   
A happy couple we would be   
   
Though oft hast made my friends my foes,    
And oft hast made me pawn my clothes,   
But since thou art so near my nose,   
It’s up, me boys, and down she goes   
   
Now since this liquor’s all drunk up,   
Methinks to you I’ll hand this cup,   
And when you’ve filled it up with sling,   
I’ll drink your health all ‘round again

## *From Rabies the Regularly Bitten*

Sailing over the Dogger Bank, oh, wasn't it a treat?  
The wind a-blowing east-northeast, we had to give our sheet  
You should to see us rally, the wind a-blowing free  
On a passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby

**So watch her, twig her, she's a proper juby-ju**  
**Give 'er sheet, let 'er rip, we're the boys to see her through**  
**You should to see us rally, the wind a-blowing free**  
**On a passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby**

Now the captain, he's a shangaroosh, and he loves a drop of good ale  
The mate, he is a chimney sweep, and been in many a jail  
The third hand was a bricker boy, thе worst of all the crew  
And take a look at thе poor old cook, he gets the buggers through

So it's watch her, twig her, it's down the street she came  
With high heels and painted toes, good Jinnie is on the game  
She is one of them flash girls, can't she cut a shine?  
She can do a double shuffle on the Knickerbocker Line

Now, we're the boys to make a noise when we come home from sea  
We get right drunk, we roll on the floor, we have a jubilee  
We get right drunk and full of beer, we roll all over the floor  
And when the rent it is all spent, we'll go to sea for more

Safe and sound at home again, let the waters roar, Jack.  
Safe and sound at home again, let the waters roar, Jack.

**Long we've tossed on the rolling main, now we're safe ashore, Jack.**  
**Don't forget yer old shipmate, faldee raldee raldee raldee rye-eye-doe\!**

Since we sailed from Plymouth Sound, four years gone, or nigh, Jack.  
Was there ever chummies, now, such as you and I, Jack?

We have worked the self-same gun, quarterdeck division.  
Sponger I and loader you, through the whole commission.

Oftentimes have we laid out, toil nor danger fearing,  
Tugging out the flapping sail to the weather earring.

When the middle watch was on, and the time went slow, boy,  
Who could choose a rousing stave, who like Jack or Joe, boy?

There she swings, an empty hulk, not a soul below now.  
Number seven starboard mess misses Jack and Joe now.

But the best of friends must part, fair or foul the weather.  
Hand yer flipper for a shake, now a drink together.

Here’s a health to the Queen and a lasting peace:  
To faction an end; to wealth increase\!  
Come let us drink while we have breath  
For there’s no drinking after death.

**And he that will this health deny**  
**Down among the dead men, down among the dead men**  
**Down, down, down, down**  
**Down among the dead men let him lie\!**

In smiling Bacchus’ joys I’ll roll;  
Deny no pleasure to my soul  
Let Bacchus’ health ‘round quickly move  
For Bacchus is a friend to love.

Let love and wine their rights maintain  
And their united pleasures reign  
While Bacchus’ treasures crown the board,  
We’ll drink the joys that both afford\!

Here’s a health to the things that we hold dear:  
Life, Love, Liberty, and Cold Beer\!  
To those who would these us deny:  
May ye sadly live and sober die\!

Bound away to the westward in the Dreadnaught we go  
**Derry down, down, down derry down.**

The time of her sailing is now drawing nigh  
Farewell pretty maids, we must bid you goodbye  
A pair of clean heels now to you we will show  
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go

Now the Dreadnaught is lying in the river Mercy   
Awaiting the tugboat to tow her to sea   
For to round the rock light where the salt tides do flow  
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go 

Now the Dreadnaught’s a-bowlin down the wild Irish Sea  
Her passengers merry; their hearts full of glee  
Her sailors like tigers walk the decks to and fro  
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go

Now the Dreadnaught’s a-sailing the Atlantic so wide  
While the dark, heavy seas roll along her black sides,  
With her tops’ls set taut for the red cross to show  
Bound away in the Dreadnaught to the westward we go

Now the Dreadnaught’s arriving in old New York town  
We’re bound for the bow’ry and let sorrow drown  
With our gals and our beer, boys we’ll let the song flow\!   
She’s a saucy flash packet; oh lord let her go\! 

Here’s a health to the Dreadnaught and all her brave crew   
To bold Captain Samuels and his officers too  
You may talk of your fliers Swallowtail and Black Ball  
But the Dreadnaught’s the packet that outsails them all\!

Tie him to the topmast while she’s yardarm under 

Heave him by the leg in a runnin’ bowline

# Eddystone Light  {#eddystone-light}

My father was the keeper of the Eddystone light   
And he slept with a mermaid one fine night   
Out of this union there came three   
A porpoise and a porgy and the other was me\!   
**Yo ho ho, the wind blows free,**    
**Oh for the life on the rolling sea***\!*    
   
One night, as I was a-trimming the glim    
Singing a verse from the evening hymn    
I heard a voice cry out "Ahoy\!"    
And there was my mother, sitting on a buoy.  

"Oh, what has become of my children three?"    
My mother then inquired of me.    
“One's on exhibit as a talking fish    
The other was served in a chafing dish.”  

Then the phosphorus flashed in her seaweed hair.    
I looked again, and my mother wasn't there    
But her voice came angrily out of the night    
"To Hell with the keeper of the Eddystone Light\!"

# Excursion Around The Bay {#excursion-around-the-bay}

## *Johnny Burke*

Well it was on this Monday morning and the day be calm and fine  
A harbour grace excursion with the boys who had the time  
And just before the sailor took the gangway from the pier  
I saw some fellow haul me wife aboard as a volunteer

**Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife cry,**  
**Oh me, oh my, I think I'm gonna die\!**  
**Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife say,**  
**"I wish I'd never taken this excursion around the bay"**

We had three hundred souls on board, oh what a splendid sight,  
Matt Strong in regimentals, to make our spirits bright;  
With meself being in the double, with the funny things they'd say,  
And they'd choke themselves from laughing, when they see us in the bay.

Now, me wife she got no better, she turned a sickly green,  
I gave her soap and candy, fat pork and gasoline;  
Castor-oil and sugar of candy, I rubbed hair-oil on her face,  
And they said she'd be a dandy, when she reaches Harbour Grace.

My wife she got no better, my wife, my darling dear,  
The screeches from her throat, you could hear in Carbonear;  
I searched every place in Harbour Grace, searched every store and shop,  
To get her something for the cure, or take her to the hop.

Oh, she died below the Brandies, as we were coming back,  
We buried her in the ocean, wrapped up in the Union Jack;  
And now I am a single man, in search of a pretty face,  
And the woman who says she'll have me, I'm off for Harbour Grace\!

# Farewell To Nova Scotia {#farewell-to-nova-scotia}

The sun was setting in the West  
The birds were singing on every tree  
All nature seemed inclined to rest  
But still there was no rest for me

**So farewell to Nova Scotia, your sea-bound coast**  
**Let your mountains dark and drear-y be**  
**For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed**  
**Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?**

I grieve to leave my native land  
I grieve to leave my comrades all  
And my parents whom I held so dear  
And the bonny bonny lassie that I do adore

Well the drums do beat and the wars do alarm  
My captain calls, I must obey  
So farewell, farewell to Nova Scotia’s charms  
For it’s early in the morning I'll be far far away

I have three brothers, they are at rest  
Their arms are folded on their breast  
But a poor simple sailor just like me  
Must be tossed and driven on the dark blue sea

*Won’t you keep a watch on Nova Scotia’s shores for me*

# Farewell To Tarwathie  {#farewell-to-tarwathie}

   
Farewell to Tarwathie, adieu, Mormond Hill,   
And the dear land of Crimmond, I bid ye farewell;   
I'm bound out for Greenland and ready to sail,   
In hopes to find riches in hunting the whale.   
   
Adieu to my comrades, for a while we must part,   
And likewise the dear lass, wha’ fair won my heart;   
The cold ice of Greenland, my love will not chill,   
And the longer our absence, more loving she'll feel.   
   
Our ship is well rigged and she's ready to sail,   
Our crew they are anxious to follow the whale;   
Where the icebergs do float and the stormy winds blow,   
Where the land and the ocean are covered with snow.   
   
Oh the cold coast of Greenland is barren and bare,   
No seed-time or harvest is ever known there;   
The birds here sing sweetly on mountain and dale,   
But there is na’ a birdie to sing to the whale.   
   
There is no habitation, for a man to live there,   
And the king of that country is the fierce Greenland bear;   
And there'll be no temptation, to tarry long there,   
With our ship bumper full we will homeward repair

**I’ll fathom the bowl,**

Sweet oranges and apples from Portugal come,  
But stout and strong cider are Ireland’s control  
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.

Me wife she do disturb me when I’m lyin’ at my ease  
She does as she likes; she says as she please.  
Me wife, she’s the devil, her heart’s hard as coal.  
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.

Me father he do lie in the depths of the sea  
No stone at his head, but what matters for he  
It’s a clear crystal fountain near Ireland doth roll  
Give me the punch ladle; I’ll fathom the bowl.

Come all ye bold heroes, give an ear to me song\!

**And I’ll see you someday on Fiddler’s Green**   
   
Oh, Fiddler’s Green is a place I’ve heard tell   
Where fishermen go if they don’t go to Hell   
Where the weather is fair and the dolphins do play   
And the cold coast of Greenland is far far away   
   
Where the sky’s always blue and there’s never a gale   
Where the fish jump on board with a swish of their tails   
Where you lie at your leisure, there’s no work to do   
And the skipper’s below making tea for the crew   
   
When you get back to dock and your long trip is through   
There’s pubs, and there’s clubs, and there’s lassies there, too   
The girls are all pretty and the beer is all free   
And there’s bottles of rum growing on every tree   
   
Well I don’t want a harp nor a halo, not me   
Just give me a breeze and a good rolling sea   
And I’ll play me old squeezebox as we sail along  
With the wind in the rigging to sing me this song

# Fields of Athenry {#fields-of-athenry}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young girl calling  
“Michael, they have taken you away  
For you stole Trevelyan’s corn, so the young might see the morn  
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay”

**Low lie the fields of Athenry**  
**Where once we watched the small free birds fly**  
**Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing**  
**It’s so lonely ’round the fields of Athenry**

By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling  
“Nothing matters, Mary, when you’re free  
Against the famine and the crown I rebelled, they ran me down  
Now you must raise our child with dignity”

By a lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star falling  
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky  
And she’ll wait and hope and pray, for her love in Botany Bay  
It’s so lonely ’round the fields of Athenry

Now it's three long years since we made her pay  
**Haul away, me laddie-o**  
And the owners say that she's had her day  
**Sing haul away, me laddie-o**

So it's heave away for the final trawl  
It's an easy pull, for the catch is small

Now it’s stow your gear, lads, and batten down  
And I'll take the wheel, lads, and turn her round

And we'll join "The Venture" and "The Morning Star"  
Riding high and empty towards the bar  
For I'd rather beach her on the skerry rock  
Than to see her torched in the breakers Docklands 

And when I die, you can stow me down  
In her rusty hold, where the breakers sound

Then I'll make the haven of Fiddler's Green  
Where the grub is good and the bunks are clean

For I've fished a lifetime, boy and man  
And the final trawl scarcely nets a cran

So it's heave away for the final trawl  
It's an easy pull, for the catch is small

# Finnegan’s Wake {#finnegan’s-wake}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

Tim Finnegan lived in Walker Street  
A gentle Irishman, mighty odd  
He’d a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet  
And to rise in the world he carried a hod  
Tim had a sort of a tipplin’ way  
With the love of the liquor, poor Tim was born  
And to help him on with his work each day  
He’d a drop of the craythür every morn’

**Whack fol the da, now, dance to your partner**  
**’Round the floor your trotters shake**  
**Wasn't it the truth I tell you**  
**Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake**

One morning Tim was rather full  
His head felt heavy, which made him shake  
He fell from the ladder and he broke his skull  
And they carried him home, his corpse to wake  
They rolled him up in a nice clean sheet  
And laid him out upon the bed  
With a gallon of whiskey at his feet  
And a barrel of porter at his head

His friends assembled at the wake  
And Mrs. Finnegan called for lunch  
First they brought in tea and cake  
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch  
Biddy O’Brien began to cry  
“Such a nice clean corpse did you ever see?  
Tim, mavournin, why did you die?”  
“Ah, hold your gob,” said Paddy McGee

Then Maggie O’Connor took up the job  
“O Biddy,” says she, “you’re wrong I’m sure”  
Biddy gave her a belt in the gob  
And left her sprawling on the floor  
Then the war did soon engage  
’Twas woman-to-woman and man-to-man  
Shillelagh law was all the rage  
And a row and a ruction soon began

Then Mickey Maloney raised his head  
When a gallon of whiskey flew at him  
It missed, and falling on the bed  
The liquor scattered over Tim\!  
Tim revives, look how he rises  
Timothy rising from the bed  
“Whirl your whiskey ‘round like blazes,  
Thundering Christ, d’you think I’m dead?”

# Fire Down Below {#fire-down-below}

## *From Tripple Nipple Jones*

I'm just a simple country lad to London just come down  
To tell you the scrapes and narrow escapes I had when last in town.  
 'Twas market day and I'd sold me hay  
And stood things to admire.  
When all at once a chap called out   
He'd mastermind the fire.

**Fire fire fire, fire down below.**  
**Let's hope that we may never see a fire down below.**

I turned around to ask a lass the cause of all this stir,  
And if she'd mind as to be so kind as to tell me where it where.  
Said she "Young man, yes that I can,   
Do all that you inquire,  
So come with me, and you shall see,   
I'll take you where there's fire."

With that she linked her arm in mine and down the street she steered  
To some back slum she called her home but still no fire appeared.  
In a house we creeped, upstairs we peeped  
Three stories high and higher.  
In a room we stopped, all night we popped  
But I couldn't find the fire.

In the morning when I wakened up, my lady bird had flown.  
Not only lass, but all my brass, my watch my clothes were gone.  
Bare laggin' in feet, I ran in the street  
Me shirt me sole attire.  
The women all laughed, the men they chaffed   
But I kept callin' FIRE\!

But some good chance, I made it home, half-dead with shame and fright,  
And all that saw and knew me well said, "Rascal, served you right."  
But the worst wasn't past, it came at last,  
I thought I should expire.  
Say what you will I was very ill   
And the doctor said 'twas fire.

So come all you good gentleman, well courting have not been  
Be advised by me, don't foolish be, by all I've done and seen.  
Don't miss your ways on market days  
Or stand things to admire,  
But avoid back slums and female chums  
And don't go catching fire.

# Fish in the Sea {#fish-in-the-sea}

Come all you young sailormen, listen to me  
I'll sing you a song of the fish in the sea,  
and it's...

**Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys**  
**When the wind blows we're all together, boys**  
**Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow**  
**Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.**

Up jumps the eel with his slippery tail,  
Climbs up aloft and reefs the topsail,  
and it's...

Then up jumps the shark with his nine rows of teeth  
Saying, 'You eat the dough boys, and I'll eat the beef\!'  
and it's...

Up jumps the lobster with his heavy claws,  
Bites the main boom right off by the jaws\!   
and it's...

Up jumps the halibut, lies flat on the deck  
He says, 'Mister Captain, don't step on my neck\!'  
and it's...

Up jumps the herring, the king of the sea,  
Saying, 'All other fishes, now you follow me\!'  
and it's...

Up jumps the codfish with his chuckle-head,  
He runs out up forward and throws out the lead\!  
and it's...

Up jumps the whale, the largest of all,  
'If you want any wind, well, I'll blow ye a squall\!'  
and it's…

# The Flowers Of Bermuda {#the-flowers-of-bermuda}

## *Stan Rogers* 

**(S)he was the captain of the Nightingale**   
**Twenty-one days from Clyde in coal**   
**(S)he could smell the flowers of Bermuda in the gale**   
**When (s)he died on the North Rock shoal**   
   
Just five short hours from Bermuda   
In a fine October gale   
There came a cry, " Oh, there be breakers dead ahead   
From the collier Nightingale   
No sooner had the captain brought her round,   
Came a rending crash below   
Hard on her beam ends groaning, went the Nightingale   
And o’erside her mainmast goes   
   
"O captain are we all for drowning,"   
Came a cry from all the crew   
"The boats be smashed\!  How are we all then to be saved?   
They are stove in through and through   
O are ye brave and hardy colliermen   
Or are you blind and cannot see   
The captain's gig still lies before ye whole and sound   
And it shall carry all of we   
   
But when the crew was all assembled   
And the gig prepared for sea   
'Twas seen there were but eighteen places to be manned   
Nineteen mortal souls were we   
But cries the captain, *"Now do not delay*   
*Nor do you spare a thought for me*   
*My duty is to save you all now if I can*   
*See ye return quick as can be\!”*  
   
Oh, there be flowers in Bermuda   
Beauty lies on every hand   
And there be laughter ease and drink for every man   
But there is no joy for me   
For when we reached the wretched Nightingale   
What an awful sight was plain   
The captain, drowned, was tangled in the mizzen chains   
Smiling bravely beneath the sea

# Foggy Dew {#foggy-dew}

## 

## *From Tripple Nipple Jones*

As down the glen one Easter morn, to a city fair rode I   
There arm-ed lines of marching men, in squadrons passed me by   
No fife did hum, nor battle drum, did sound its dread tattoo,   
But the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out through the foggy dew 

Right proudly high over Dublin Town, they hung out the flag of war   
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky, than at Sulva[^6] or Sud El Bar[^7]   
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through   
While Britannia's Huns, with their long range guns, sailed in through the foggy dew 

Oh the night fell black, and the rifles' crack made perfidious Albion reel  
In the leaden rain, seven tongues of flame did shine o'er the lines of steel  
By each shining blade a prayer was said, that to Ireland her sons be true  
But when morning broke, still the war flag shook out its folds in the foggy dew

'Twas Britannia bade our Wild Geese go, that small nations might be free   
But their lonely graves are by Sulva's waves, or the shore of the Great North Sea   
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Cathal Brugha[^8]   
Their names we will keep, where the fenians sleep, 'neath the shroud of the foggy dew

But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell, rang mournfully and clear   
For those who died, that Eastertide, in the springing of the year   
And the world did gaze, in deep amaze, at those fearless men but few   
Who bore the fight, that freedom's light, might shine through the foggy dew

# Free in the Harbour {#free-in-the-harbour}

## *Stan Rogers*

Well it’s blackfish at play in Hermitage Bay  
From Pushthrough across to Bois Island  
They broach and they sprout and they lift their flukes out  
And they wave to a town that is dying  
Now it’s many’s the boats that have plied on the foam  
Hauling away\! Hauling away\!  
But there’s many more fellas been leaving their homes  
Where the whales make free in the harbour.

**Free in the harbour**  
**The blackfish are sporting again**  
**Free in the harbour**  
**Untroubled by comings and goings of men**  
**Who once did pursue them as oil from the sea,**  
**Hauling away\! Hauling away\!**  
**Now they’re Calgary roughnecks from Hermitage Bay**  
**Where the whales make free in the harbour.**

It’s at Portage and Main you’ll see them again  
On their way to the hills of Alberta  
With lop-side grins, they waggle their chins  
And they brag of the wage they’ll be earning  
Then it’s “Quick, pull the string boys, and get the tool out,”  
Haul it away\! Haul it away\!  
But just two years ago you could hear the same shout  
Where the whales make free in the harbour.

Well, it’s living they’ve found, deep in the ground  
And if there’s doubts, it’s best they ignore them  
Nor think on the bones, the crosses and stones  
Of their fathers that came there before them  
In the taverns of Edmonton, fishermen shout  
Haul it away\! Haul it away\!  
They left three hundred years buried up the Bay  
Where the whales make free in the harbour.

# Get Up Jack, John Sit Down  {#get-up-jack,-john-sit-down}

Well ships may come and ships may go, as long as the seas do roll   
And a sailor lad, just like his dad, he loves his rum and bowl   
Now a lass ashore he do adore, a woman who’s plump and round   
**But when your money’s all gone it’s the same old song:** 

**Get up Jack, John sit down\!**   
**Come along, come along me jolly brave boys**   
**There’s plenty more grog in the jar**   
**We’ll plow the briny ocean with a jolly roving tar** 

When Jack’s ashore he’ll make his way to some old boarding house   
He’s welcomed in with rum and gin, likewise with fork and scouse   
And he’ll spend and he’ll spend and never offend, ’til he lies drunk on the ground… 

When Jack is old and weather-beat, too old to sail about   
They’ll let him stop at some grog shop ’til eight bells calls him out   
Then he’ll raise his glass high, and loudly he’ll cry “Thank God I’m homeward bound…”

# Glorious Ale {#glorious-ale}

## *From Barefoot the Bootless*

When I was a young man my father did say,  
Summer is coming and it’s time to make hay.  
And when hay is carted don’t you never fail  
For to drink gaffer’s health in a pint of good ale.

**Ale, Ale, Glorious Ale,**  
**Served up in pewter it tells its own tale.**  
**Some folk like radishes, some curleye kale,**  
**But give I boiled parsnips and a great dish of taters**  
**And a lump of fatty bacon**  
**And a pint of good ale**

Now our MP’s in parliament, our faith for to keep;  
I hope’s now we put him there, he won’t sit and sleep.  
But he’ll always get my vote if he never fail  
For to keep down the price of our good English ale.

Now take all teetotallers, who drink water neat,  
Well it must rot their gutses and give ’em damp feet.  
But I always say that a chap can’t grow stale  
On broad beans and bacon and a pint of good ale.

# The Golden Vanity {#the-golden-vanity}

There was a lofty ship and they put her out to sea  
And the name of the ship was the Golden Vanity  
And they sailed her on **the lowland lowland low**  
**And they sailed her on the lowland sea**

And she had not been sailing but two weeks or three  
When she was overtaken by a Turkish revelry  
As she sailed along the lowland lowland low...

Then boldly up spoke our little cabin boy  
Saying, What would you give me if the galley I destroy  
If I sink them in the lowland lowland low

To the man that them destroys, our captain then replied  
Five thousand pounds and my daughter for his bride  
If he'll sink them in the lowland lowland low

The boy he made ready and overboard went he  
And he swam to the side of the Turkish enemy  
As she lay along the lowlands lowlands low

And he had a brace and auger made for the use  
And he bored nine holes in her hull all at once  
As she lay along the lowland lowland low

And some were playing poker and some were playing dice  
And some were in their hammocks and the sea as cold as ice  
And the water rushed in and it dazzled to their eyes

He swam back to his ship and he beat upon the side  
Crying, Shipmates take me up for I'm wearied with the tide  
And I'm weary of the lowlands lowlands low

Well, I'll not pick you up, the captain then replied  
I'll shoot you, I'll drown you, I'll sink you in the tide  
I will sink you in the lowland lowland low

If it was not for the love that I bear for your men  
I'd do unto you as I did unto them  
I would sink you in the lowland lowland low

And the boy bowed his head and down sank he  
And he said farewell to the Golden Vanity  
As she lay along the lowland lowland low

# The Goodnight Song {#the-goodnight-song}

## *Jim Boyes*

**So goodnight my friends, as the dawn comes pale**  
**And the eastern wind brings the threat of gales**  
**Keep a hold on hope through the darkest vale**  
**And we’ll meet further on down the road**

I have travelled far from this island strand  
From the icy waste to the burning sand  
Ploughed the raging sea, seen the verdant land  
Been at home in a place far away

Many differences but much the same  
Though the ways are strange and have different names  
But a friendly face breaks a thousand chains  
And a smile breaks the lock on the door

We have joined in song, laughed a night away  
Swapped our tales of woe, kept the clouds at bay  
In the morning clear we’ll be on our way  
But we’ll meet further on down the road

So let's drink a health to good times gone by  
When our spirits soared and we touched the sky  
And we’ll bid farewell but not goodbye  
And we’ll meet further on down the road

# The Good Ship Venus {#the-good-ship-venus}

## *From Barefoot the Bootless*

**Frigging on the rigging**  
**frigging on the rigging**  
**frigging on the rigging**  
**There’s fuck all else to do.**

Twas on the good ship Venus,  
By God you should have seen us,  
The figurehead was a whore in bed  
And the mast a phalic genus.

The captain's wife was Mabel,  
Whenever she was able,  
She'd fornicate the second mate  
Upon the galley table.

The second mate's name was Andy,   
His balls were long and bandy,  
We filled his arse with molten brass   
For wanking in the brandy.

The cabin boy was Kipper,  
A dirty little nipper,  
We stuffed his arse with broken glass  
To circumcise the skipper.

The captain's name was Morgan,  
By Christ he was a gorgon\!  
Ten times a day sweet tunes he's play  
On his productive organ.

Another cook was O'Malley,  
He didn't dilly dally,  
He shot his bolt with such a jolt  
He whitewashed half the galley.

Another one was Cropper,  
Oh Christ he had a whopper.  
Twice round the deck, around his neck  
And up his bum for a stopper.

So now we end this serial,  
Through sheer lack of material.  
I wish you luck and freedom from  
Diseases venereal.

Frigging on the rigging;   
Wanking on the planking,   
Tossing on the crossing,   
There was fuck all else to do

# Greenland Whale Fisheries

   
They took us jolly sailor lads  
A-fishing for the whale  
In the year of our lord eighteen hundred and six  
Bound for Greenland we set sail

The lookout stood on the crosstrees high  
With a spyglass in his hand  
There's a whale, there's a whale, there's a whalefish, he cried  
And she blows at every span

The Captain stood on the quarter deck  
And a sod of a man was he  
Overhaul, overhaul, let your davit tackles fall  
And we'll launch them boats to sea

We stuck that whale and the line played out  
But she gave a flurry with her tail  
And the boat capsized, we lost seven of our men  
And we never caught that whale

Now the losing of seven fine seamen  
Oh it grieved our captain sore  
But the losing of that bloody sperm whale  
Oh it grieved him ten times more

Now Greenland is a horrid place  
Where us fisher-lads have to go  
Where the rose and the lily never bloom in Spring  
And there's only ice and snow

# The Grey Funnel Line  {#the-grey-funnel-line}

## *Cyril Tawney*

Don’t mind the rain, nor the rolling sea   
The weary night never worries me   
But the hardest time in a sailor’s day   
Is to watch the sun as it dies away   
**It’s one more day on the Grey Funnel Line**   
   
The finest ship that sailed the sea   
Is still a prison for the likes of me   
But give me wings like Noah’s dove   
I’d fly up harbour to the girl I love…   
   
Every time I gaze behind the screws   
Makes me long for old Peter’s shoes   
I’d walk on  down that silver lane   
And take my love in my arms again   
   
O Lord, if dreams were only real   
I’d have my hands on that wooden wheel   
And with all my heart I’d turn her ’round   
And tell the crew that we’re homeward bound   
   
I’ll pass the time like some machine   
Until the blue water turns to green   
Then I’ll dance on down that walk ashore   
And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more

# Hanging Johnny {#hanging-johnny}

## *From Barefoot the Bootless*

Oh, they calls me Hangin’ Johnny,  
**Away, boys, away\!**  
They says I hangs for money,  
**So ha-ang, bo-oys, hang\!**

They says I hang for money,  
But hangin’ is so funny,

At first I hanged me daddy,  
An’ then I hanged me mammy.

Oh, yes, I hanged me mother,  
Me sister, an’ me brudder.

I hanged me sister Sally,  
I hanged the whole damn family.

An’ then I hanged me granny,  
I hanged her up quite canny.

I’d hang the mate and skipper,  
I’d hang ’em by their flippers.

I’d hang a ruddy copper,  
I’d give him the long dropper.

I’d hang a rotten liar,  
I’d hang a bloomin’ frair.

A rope, a beam, a ladder,  
I’d hang yous all together.

We’ll sail and roam and plunder  
Us they’ll never tear asunder

We will have no fear  
When our hangin’ day comes near

For even once we’re strung  
We live through the songs we’ve sung

No they can never kill us  
We’ll live on with the chorus

We’ll hang an’ haul together,  
We’ll hang for better weather.

# Haul Away Joe {#haul-away-joe}

## *The first song ever sung by the crew in a show* 

   
When I was a little boy my mother always told me   
**’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe**   
That if I did not kiss the girls my lips would grow all moldy  
**’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe**   
   
Once in my life I married a wife but she was mean and lazy…   
Then I met an Irish girl, she drives me crazy…   
   
**’Way, haul away, we’re bound for better weather**   
**’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe**   
   
Once I was in Ireland, a-digging turf and taters   
But now I’m on a pirate ship, a-hauling on the braces   
   
St. Patrick drove away the snakes, then drank up all the whiskey   
This made him sing and dance a jig, he felt so fine and frisky   
   
**’Way, haul away, we’re bound for better weather**   
**’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe**   
   
You call yourself a second mate but you can’t tie a bowline   
You cannot even stand up straight when the ship is a-rolling   
   
The cook is in the galley making duff so handy   
The captain’s in his cabin drinking wine and brandy   
   
**’Way, haul away, the good ship is a-rolling**   
**’Way, haul away, we’ll haul away Joe**

Haul on the bowline, Liverpool’s a fine town…

Haul on the bowline, Kitty’s on the game again

Haul on the bowline, the good ship is a-rolling

Haul on the bowline, the old man is a-growling

Haul on the bowline, we’ll either break or bend her

Haul on the bowline, we’re man enough to mend her

Haul on the bowline, and bust the chafing leather

Haul on the bowline, we’ll hang for finer weather

Haul on the bowline, Hall is my sister’s name

Come cheer up my lads 'tis to glory we steer  
To add something new to this wonderful year.  
To honor we call you as free men not slaves  
For who are so free as the sons of the wave.

**Heart of oak are our ships, heart of oak are our men.**  
**We always are ready.  Steady, boys, steady**  
**we’ll fight and we’ll conquer again and again**

Our worthy fore fathers, let's give them a cheer  
To climates unknown did courageously steer,  
Through oceans to deserts for freedom they came  
And dying bequeathed us their freedom and fame.

We never see our foes but we wish them to stay,  
They never see us but they wish us away.  
If they run, why we follow, and run them ashore,  
And if they won't fight us, we can do no more.

I wish her safe landing without any shock  
And if ever I should meet you by land or by sea  
I will always remember your kindness to me

“Oh Willy love, oh Willy, come list what I do say  
My feet they are so tender, I cannot march away  
And besides, my dearest Willy, I am with child by thee  
Not fitted for the war, me love, in High Germany.”

Oh, cursed be them cruel wars whenever they should rise  
And out of Merry England press many a man likewise  
They pressed me true love from me, likewise my brothers three  
And sent them to the war, me love, in High Germany.

Me friends I do not value nor me foes I do not fear,  
Now my love has left me I wander far and near  
And when me baby it is born and smiling on my knee

# Hoist Up The Thing {#hoist-up-the-thing}

## 

## *The Longest Johns*

Fresh out of college with grades straight from Hell  
I browsed for a trade at which I could excel  
An ad for a ship in need of some manning  
Men, sails, and purpose, but lacking a captain

What luck, says I, to find such good fortune  
A few white lies later, I ran down the pier  
Bought me a coat and a cutlass or two  
Jumped on the deck, and I yelled at the crew

**Hoist up the thing\! Batten down the whatsit\!**  
**What's that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it\!**  
**Turn hard to port\!** *\[That's not port?\]* **Now I've got it\!**  
**Trust me, I'm in control\!**

I can't sing the shanties, it has to be said  
And all of that grog just goes right to my head  
Whale meat is gross, and I miss a girl's laugh  
Five weeks at sea, even Dave seems a catch\!

We've hit icy waters, no land to be seen  
The food's getting low, and the beer has gone green  
There's murmurs of discontent under the deck  
If I don't act fast, it could be my neck\!

So pull up the charts and those weird gold machines  
I see what it says, but no clue what it means\!  
Just pull on some levers and yank on some chains  
Feign a bad back til' we've landed again

**Hoist up the thing\! Batten down the whatsit\!**  
**What's that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it\!**  
**Turn hard to port\!** *\[This is jail?\]* **Now I've got it\!**  
**Trust me, I'm in control\!**

I’ll Tell Me Ma

**The boys won’t leave the girls alone**  
**They pulled my hair, they stole my comb**  
**But that’s alright ’til I go home**  
**She is handsome, she is pretty**  
**She’s the belle of Belfast city**  
**She’s a-courting, one two three**  
**Please won’t you tell me who is she**

Albert Mooney says he loves her  
All the boys are fighting for her  
Knocking on the door, ringing on the bell  
Singing, “oh, my true love, are you well?”  
Out she comes now, watch her go  
Rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes  
Old Jenny Murphy says she’ll die  
If she don’t get the fellow with the roving eye

Oh the wind and the rain and the hail blow high  
And the snow comes a tumbling from the sky  
She’s as nice as apple pie  
And she’ll get her own lad by-and-by  
When she gets a lad of her own  
She won’t tell her ma when she comes home  
Let them all come as they will  
For it’s Albert Mooney she loves still

# I’se The B’y  {#i’se-the-b’y}

   
I’s the b’y that builds the boat   
And I’s the b’y that sails her   
I’s the b’y that catches the fish   
And takes ’em home to ’Lizer   
   
**Hip your partner, Sally Tibbo**   
**Hip your partner, Sally Brown**   
**Fogo, Twillingate, Morton’s Harbour**   
**All around the circle**   
   
Sods and rinds to cover your flake   
Cake and tea for supper   
Codfish in the spring o’ the year   
Fried in maggoty butter   
   
I don’t want your maggoty fish   
That’s no good for winter   
I could buy as good as that   
Down in Bonavista   
   
I took ’Lizer to a dance   
And faith, but she could travel   
And every step that she did take   
Was up to her knees in gravel   
   
Susan White, she’s out of sight   
Her petticoat wants a border   
Old Sam Oliver in the dark   
He kissed her in the corner

# The Irish Rover  {#the-irish-rover}

   
In the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and six   
We set sail from the Coal Quay of Cork   
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks   
For the grand City Hall in New York   
We’d an elegant craft, it was rigged ’fore and aft   
And how the trade winds drove her   
She had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts   
And they called her the Irish Rover   
   
There was Barney Magee from the banks of the Lee   
There was Hogan from County Tyrone   
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work   
And a chap from Westmeath named Malone   
There was Slugger O’Toole, who was drunk as a rule   
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover   
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann   
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover    
   
There was awl Mickey Coote, who played hard on his flute   
When the ladies lined up for his set   
He was tooting with skill for each sparkling quadrille   
Though the dancers were fluttered and bet   
With his sparse, witty talk he was cock of the walk   
As he rolled the dames under and over   
They all knew at a glance when he took off his pants  
That he sailed in the Irish Rover   
   
We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags   
We had two million barrels of bone   
We had three million bales of old nanny goats’ tails   
We had four million barrels of stone   
We had five million hogs and six million dogs   
And seven million barrels of porter   
We had eight million sides of old blind horses’ hides   
In the hold of the Irish Rover   
   
We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out   
And our ship lost her way in a fog   
And a whale of a crew was reduced down to two   
’Twas myself and the captain’s old dog   
Then the ship struck a rock, oh, Lord what a shock   
And nearly tumbled over   
She turned nine times around, then the poor old dog was drowned   
I’m the last of the Irish Rover

# John Kamaka[^9] {#john-kamaka}

## *Additional verses by the crew*

   
I thought I heard the Old Man say   
**John Kamakamaka too-ri-ay**   
Today today is a holiday   
**John Kamakamaka too-ri-ay**   
   
**Too-ri-ay, oh too-ri-ay**   
**John Kamakamaka too-ri-ay**   
   
I thought I heard the boatswain say…   
There’s work tomorrow but no work today…   
   
The boatswain says “Before I’m through   
You’ll curse your mother for having you”   
   
There’s rotten meat and weev’ly bread   
Just like the Gate the Old Man said   
   
She would not steer and she would not stay   
She shipped the water both night and day   
   
We’re all Liverpool born and bred   
Strong in the arm but thick in the head   
   
Growl ye may but go you must   
If you growl too loud your head they’ll bust   
   
Around Cape Horn our ship must go   
Around Cape Horn through the ice and snow   
   
My dear old mum she wrote to me   
Oh son, my son come home from sea   
   
It’s one more pull and that will do   
And we’re the bullies to pull her through

# Johnny Come Down To Hilo  {#johnny-come-down-to-hilo}

   
Never seen the like since I been born   
An Arkansas farmer with his sea boots on   
**Johnny come down to Hilo, poor old man**   
   
**Wake her, shake her**   
**Wake that gal with the blue dress on**   
**Johnny come down to Hilo, poor old man**   
   
I got a gal across the sea   
She’s a ’Badian beauty and she says to me…   
   
Sally’s in the garden picking peas   
The hair on her head hanging down to her knees   
   
My wife she died in Tennessee   
And they sent her jawbone back to me   
   
I put that jawbone on the fence   
And I ain’t heard nothing but the jawbone since   
   
So hand me down my riding cane  
I’m off to see Ms. Sarah Jane

# Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye[^10] {#johnny-i-hardly-knew-ye}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

While on the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo (x2)  
While on the road to sweet Athy, a stick in me hand and a drop in me eye  
A doleful damsel I heard cry:  
“Johnny I hardly knew ye”

**With guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo (x2)**  
**With guns and drums and drums and guns, the enemy nearly slew ye**  
**My darlin dear ye look so queer**  
**Johnny I hardly knew ye**

Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo, hurroo (x2)  
Where are the eyes that looked so mild when my heart ye first beguiled  
Why did ye skedaddle from me and the child  
Johnny I hardly knew ye

Where are the legs with which ye run, hurroo, hurroo (x2)  
Where are the legs with which ye run when first ye went to carry a gun  
Indeed yer dancing days are done  
Johnny I hardly knew ye

I’m happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo (x2)  
I’m happy for to see ye home, all from the island of Ceylon[^11]  
So low in flesh, so high in bone  
Johnny I hardly knew ye

They’re rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo (x2)  
They’re rolling out the guns again, but they’ll never take our sons again  
No they’ll never take our sons again  
Johnny I’m swearin’ to ye

# Johnny Jump Up {#johnny-jump-up}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

I’ll tell you a story that happened to me  
One day as I went down to Yule-by-the-Sea  
The sun it was bright and the day it was warm  
Says I, “a quiet pint wouldn’t do me no harm”  
I went in to the barman, I said “Give me a stout.”  
Said the barman “I’m sorry, all the beer ‘tis sold out  
Try whiskey, try sherry, ten years in the wood”  
Says I, “I’ll try cider, I’ve heard that it’s good”

**Oh never, oh never, oh never again**  
**If I live to a hundred or a hundred and ten**  
**I fell to the ground and I couldn’t get up**  
**After drinking a pint of that Johnny Jump Up**

After leaving the pub I went back to the yard  
When I bumped into Brolfy, the big civic guard  
“Come here to me, boy, don’t you know I’m the law”  
I upped with my fist and I shattered his jaw  
He fell to the ground with his knees doubled up  
But it wasn’t I’d hit him, ‘twas the Johnny Jump Up  
And the next man I met out in Yule-by-the-Sea  
Was an old man on crutches, and he said to me  
“I fear for me life I’ll be hit by a car  
Won’t you help me across to the railwaymans’ bar?”  
After a drinking a sip of that cider so sweet  
He threw down his crutches and danced in the street

I went down the Lee Road, a friend for to see  
They call it the jailhouse in Cork-by-the-Lee  
And when I got up there, the truth I should tell  
They had the poor bugger locked up in his cell  
Said the guard testing him, “say these words if you can:  
‘Around the ragged rock, the ragged rascal ran’”  
“Tell them I’m no danger, tell them I’m not bad  
It was only a drop of the creature I had”

A man died in the Union by the name of McNabb  
They washed him and laid him outside on a slab  
And after the coroner his measurements did take  
His wife took him home for a bloody fine wake  
‘Twas about twelve o’clock and the beer it was high  
The corpse he sat up, and he says with a sigh  
“I can’t get to Heaven, they won’t let me up  
’Til I bring them a pint of that Johnny Jump Up”

# Johnny[^12] Lay Back  {#johnny-lay-back}

   
’Twas a cold a dreary morning in December *(December)*   
An’ all of me money it was spent *(spent spent)*   
Where it went to, Lord I can’t remember *(remember)*   
So down to the shipping office I went *(went went)*   
   
**Johnny lay back** *(Johnny lay back\!)*   
**Take in the slack** *(Take in the slack\!)*   
**Take a turn around the capstan heave a pawl** *(Heave a pawl\!)*   
**About ship’s stations, boys, be handy** *(Be handy\!)*   
**For we’re bound for Valipariso ’round the Horn**   
   
That day there was a great demand for sailors   
For the colonies, for ’Frisco and for France   
So I shipped aboard a limey barque *The Hotspur*   
And got completely drunk on my advance   
   
I woke up in the morning sick and sore-o   
And I knew that I was outward bound again   
When I heard a voice a-bawling at the door-o   
“Lay aloft ye sods and answer to your names\!”   
   
’Twas on the quarter deck where first I saw ’em   
Such an ugly bunch I never seen before   
For there was a bum and stiff from every quarter   
And it made me poor old heart feel sick and sore   
    
I asked the mate a-which a-watch was mine-o   
Says he “I’ll soon pick out a-which is which”   
And he blowed me down and kicked me hard astern-o   
Calling me a lousy dirty son-of-a-bitch   
   
So there I was a-once more out to sea boys   
The same ol’ bloody business o’er again   
Oh, stamp the capstan ’round and make some noise, boys  
And sing again this dear ol’ sweet refrain

# Johnny’s Gone for a Soldier {#johnny’s-gone-for-a-soldier}

## *From Meister Jaeger and his sister*

Sad I sit on Buttermilk Hill  
Who could blame me, cry my fill  
And every tear would turn a mill  
Johnny's gone for a soldier

**Shul Shul shularoo**  
**Shul a rack shack shul a bobbacoo**  
**When I hear my Sally baby beel come bibble in the boo shy lorrie**

Me oh my I loved him so  
Broke my heart to see him go  
And only time can heal my woe  
Johnny’s gone for a soldier

# Join the British Army {#join-the-british-army}

## *From Tripple Nipple Jones and Smidge and Compass*

When I was young, I used to be, as fine a man as ever you'd see   
The Prince of Wales, he said to me, "Come join the British army" 

**Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, they're looking for monkeys up in the zoo**   
**Says one, if I’d a face like you, I’d join the British army**

Sarah Comden baked a cake, it was all for poor Slattery's sake   
So I threw meself into the lake, pretending I was barmy

**Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, I’ve made me mind up what to do**  
**So I’ll work my ticket home to you, and fuck the British army**

Seargent Healy went away, and his wife got in the family way  
And the only words that she could say were “Blame the British army”

**Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, me curse upon the labour crew**  
**That took your darling boy from you to join the British army**

Corporal Sheen was a terrible lout, just give him a couple of pints of stout   
And he’d beat the enemy with his mouth, and save the British Army

**Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, I’ve made me mind up what to do**  
**So I’ll work my ticket home to you, and fuck the British army**  
   
When I was young, I used to be, as fine a man as ever you'd see   
The Prince of Wales, I says to he, "The hell with the British army\!"

**Too ra loo ra loo ra loo, I’ve made me mind up what to do**  
**So I’ll work my ticket home to you, and fuck the British arm**

# The Last Saskatchewan Pirate

Oh, I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine  
I had a little stretch of land along the CP line  
But times were hard and though I tried, the money wasn't there  
And bankers came and took my land and told me fair is fair  
I looked for every kind of job, the answer always "no"  
Hire you now, they'd always laugh, we just let twenty go\!  
The government, they promised me a measly little sum  
But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum  
Then I thought who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone  
I'm gonna be a PIRATE\! on the River Saskatchewan\!

**Cause it's a heave-ho\! hi-ho\!**  
**Coming down the plains**  
**Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains**  
**And it's a ho-hey\! hi-hey\!**  
**Farmers bar your doors**  
**When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores**

Well you think the locals farmers would know that I'm at large  
But, just the other day I saw an unprotected barge  
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser  
I rammed their ship, and sank it, and I stole their fertilizer\!  
A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river  
The farmers pass in so much fear, their stomachs are a-quiver  
Because the know that TRACTOR JACK\! is waiting in the bay  
I'll jump the bridge and knock them cold and sail off with their hay\!

Well Mountie Bob he chased me, he was always at my throat  
He'd follow on the shoreline because he didn't own a boat  
But cutbacks were a-coming and the Mountie lost his job  
Now he's sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob  
A swingin' sword, and skull n' bones, and pleasant company  
I never pay my income tax and screw the GST — SCREW IT\!  
Prince Albert down to Saskatoon, I'm the terror of the sea  
If ya wanna reach the Co-op, boy, you gotta get by me\!

Well, pirate life's appealing, but you don't just find it here  
I've heard that in Alberta, there's a band of buccaneers  
They roam the Athabasca, from Smith to Fort McKay  
And you're gonna lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way  
Well winter is a-coming and a chill is in the breeze  
Our pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze  
I'll be back in springtime, but now I've to go  
I hear there's lots of plundering down in New Mexico

# The Last Shanty  {#the-last-shanty}

## *Tom Lewis (additional verse by ARRR\!\!\!)*

   
My father often told me when I was just a lad   
A sailor’s life is very hard, the food is always bad   
But now I’ve joined the Navy, I’m on board a man-o’-war   
And now I find a sailor ain’t a sailor anymore   
   
**Don’t haul on the rope, don’t climb up the mast**   
**If you see a sailing ship it might be your last**   
**Just get your civvies ready for another run ashore**   
**A sailor ain’t a sailor ain’t a sailor anymore**   
   
The killick of our mess he says we’ve had it soft   
It wasn’t like this in his day when he was up aloft   
We like our bunks and sleeping bags, but what’s a hammock for?   
Swinging from the deckhead or lying on the floor?   
   
They gave us an engine that first went up and down   
Then with more technology the engine went around   
We’re good with steam and diesel, but what’s a mainyard for?  
A stoker ain’t a stoker with a shovel anymore   
   
They gave us an Aldis Lamp so we can do it right   
They gave us a radio, we signal day and night   
We know our codes and ciphers, but what’s a “sema” for?   
A bunting-tosser doesn’t toss the bunting anymore   
   
They gave us a radar set to pierce the fog and gloom   
Now the lookout’s sitting in a tiny darkened room   
Loran does navigation, the sonar says how deep   
The Jimmy’s three sheets to the wind, the skipper’s fast asleep   
   
They gave us a songbook so we’d know what to do   
They gave us some MP3s, we listened to ’em to   
We know our scales and harmonies, but what’s a cutlass for?   
A pirate ain’t a pirate ain’t a pirate anymore   
   
Two cans of beer a day, that’s your bleeding lot   
But now we gets an extra one because they stopped the Tot   
So, we’ll put on our civvy-clothes and find a pub ashore   
A sailor’s still a sailor, just like he was before

# Leave Her, Johnny, Leave Her {#leave-her,-johnny,-leave-her}

Oh the times are hard and the wages low  
**Leave her, Johnny, leave her**  
But now once more ashore we’ll go  
**And it’s time for us to leave her**

**Leave her, Johnny, leave her**  
**Oh leave her, Johnny, leave her**  
**For the voyage is done and the winds don’t blow**  
**And it’s time for us to leave her**

The winds were foul and the work was hard....  
From the Liverpool dock to the London yard....

There was rotten meat and weev’ly bread  
You’d eat it or you’d starve to death

I hate to sail on this rotten tub  
No grog allowed and rotten grub

The skipper was bad but the mate was worse  
He’d blow you down with a spike and a curse

Oh the winds were hard and the water high  
She shipped it green and none went by

The sails are furled and the anchor is stowed  
And no more around Cape Horn we’ll go

I thought I heard the old man say  
You can go ashore and spend your pay

The rats have left, and we the crew  
It’s time, by Christ, that we did, too

We’ll make her fast and stow our gear  
The gals are a-waiting on the pier

Oh if ye can leave her like a man  
Then leave her, Johnny, while ye can

# The Leaving Of Liverpool  {#the-leaving-of-liverpool}

Farewell to Prince’s landing stage   
Mersey River, fare thee well   
I am bound for Californ-i-ay  
A place I know right well   
   
**So fare thee well my own true love**   
**And when I return, united we will be**   
**It’s not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me**   
**But my darling when I think of thee**   
   
I am bound for Californ-i-ay   
By the way of the stormy Cape Horn   
And I’ll write to you a letter, love   
When I am homeward bound   
   
I have signed on a Yankee clipper ship   
Davy Crockett is her name   
And Burgess is the captain of her   
And they say she is a floating shame   
   
I have sailed with Burgess once before   
And I think I know him right well   
If a man is a sailor, he can get along   
But if not than he’s surely in hell   
   
Oh, the fog is on the harbor love   
And I wish I could remain   
But I know it will be some long time   
Before I see you again

Lukey’s boat is painted green; it’s the prettiest boat that you’ve ever seen  
**Aha, me boys, a riddle-i-day**  
**Aha, me boys, a riddle-i-day**

Lukey’s boat’s got a fine fore cutty…  
Lukey’s boat’s got a fine fore cutty, and every seam is chinked with putty

I says, “Lukey, the blinds are down”…  
I says, “Lukey, the blinds are down; me wife is dead and she’s underground”

I says, “Lukey, I don’t care”…  
I says, “Lukey, I don’t care; I’ll get me another in the spring o’ the year”

Lukey’s rolling out his grub…  
Lukey’s rolling out his grub – one split pea in a ten pound tub

Lukey’s boat’s got high-topped sails…  
Lukey’s boat’s got high-topped sails and she was planched with copper nails

Lukey’s boat is painted green…  
Lukey’s boat is painted green; it’s the prettiest boat that you’ve ever seen

# Maggie May {#maggie-may}

Come all ye sailors bold, and when me tale is told  
I know ye all will sadly pity me  
For I was a god-damn fool in the port o’ Liverpool  
On the voyage when I first paid off from sea

**Oh Maggie Maggie May, they have taken you away**  
**For to slave upon Van Dieman’s cruel shore**  
**Oh, you robbed many a sailor, and many a drunken whaler**  
**But you’ll never cruise down Paradise Street no more\!**

I paid off at the Home, after a voyage from Sierra Leone  
Two pound ten a month had been my pay;  
As I jingled in me tin, I was sadly taken in  
By a lady of the name of Maggie May

When I steered into her, I hadn’t got a care  
I was cruisin’ up and down old Canning Place;  
She was in a gown so fine, like a frigate of the line,  
And bein’ a sailorman, I gave her chase

**Chorus**

She gave me a saucy nod, and like a farmer’s clod  
I let her take me line abreast in tow  
An’ under all plain sail, we ran before the gale  
An’ to the Crow’s Nest Tavern we did go

Next mornin’ when I woke, I found that I was broke  
I hadn’t got a penny to me name  
So I had to pop me suit, me John Ls and me Boots  
Down in the Kelly Pawn Shop Number Nine

**Oh you theivin’ Maggie May, ye robbed me of my pay**  
**When I slept with you that night ashore**  
**Oh, guilty the jury found her, for robbin’ a homeward-bounder**  
**And she’ll never roll down Paradise Street no more**

She was chained and sent away from Liverpool one day;  
The lads they cheered as she sailed down the Bay  
And every sailor lad, he only was too glad  
They’d sent the old gal out to Botany Bay\!

# The Magpie {#the-magpie}

## *From Barefoot the Bootless*

**One's for sorrow, two's for joy**  
**Three's for a girl and four's for a boy**  
**Five's for silver, six for gold**  
**Seven's for a secret never told**  
**Devil, devil, I defy thee (x3)**

Oh, the magpie brings us tidings  
Of news both fair and foul  
She's more cunning than the raven  
More wise than any owl  
For she brings us news of the harvest  
Of the barley, wheat, and corn  
And she knows when we'll go to our graves  
And how we shall be born

She brings us joy when from the right  
Grief when from the left  
Of all the news that's in the air  
We know to trust her best  
For she sees us at our labour  
And she mocks us at our work  
And she steals the eggs from out of the nest  
And she can mob the hawk

The priest, he says we're wicked  
For to worship the devil's bird  
Ah, but we respect the old ways  
And we disregard his word  
For we know they rest uneasy  
As we slumber in the night  
And we'll always leave out a little bit of meat  
For the bird that's black and white

# Marching Inland {#marching-inland}

## *From Chase the Wild Goose*

Lord Nelson knew the perfect way to cure your *mal de mer*  
And if you pay attention, his secret I will share  
To any sea-sick sailor he'd give this advice for free:  
"If you're feeling sea-sick, sit underneath a tree\!"

**I'm marching inland from the shore**  
**Over me shoulder I'm carryin' an oar**  
**When someone asks me: "What is that funny thing you got?"**  
**Then I know I'll never go to sea no more, no more**  
**Then I know I'll never go to sea no more\!**

Drake he's in his hammock and a thousand miles away  
Grenville's Revenge is at the bottom of the bay  
Many's a famous sailor never came home from sea  
So take my advice, Jack, come and follow me

Sailors take a lesson from this crew of high renown  
When you leave the ocean and it's time to settle down  
Never cast your anchor less than ninety miles from shore  
There'd always be temptation to be off to sea once more

# The Mariner's Revenge Song  {#the-mariner's-revenge-song}

## *The Decemberists*

We are two mariners  
Our ship's sole survivors  
In this belly of a whale.  
Its ribs are ceiling beams  
Its guts are carpeting  
I guess we have some time to kill.

You may not remember me  
I was a child of three  
And you, a lad of eighteen.  
But I remember you  
And I will relate to you  
How our histories interweave:

At the time you were arake and a roustabout  
Spending all your money on the whores[^13] and hounds (oh, oh)

You had a charming air  
All cheap and debonair  
My widowed mother found so sweet,  
And so she took you in  
Her sheets still warm with him  
Now filled with filth and foul disease.

As time wore on you proved a debt-ridden drunken mess  
Leaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch (oh, oh)

And then you disappeared  
Your gambling arrears  
The only thing you left behind.  
And then the magistrate  
Reclaimed our small estate  
And my poor mother lost her mind.

Then, one day in spring my dear sweet mother died  
But, before she did I took her hand as she, dying, cried: (oh, oh)

**"Find him, Bind him**  
**Tie him to a pole and break**  
**His fingers to splinters**  
**Drag him to a hole until he**  
**Wakes up naked**  
**Clawing at the ceiling**  
**Of his grave\!”**

it took me fifteen years  
To swallow all my tears  
Among the urchins in the street  
Until a priory  
Took pity and hired me  
To keep their vestry nice and neat.

But, never once in the employ of these holy men  
Did I ever, once turn my mind from the thought of revenge (oh, oh)

One night I overheard  
The prior exchanging words  
With a penitent whaler from the sea:  
The captain of his ship  
Who matched you toe to tip  
Was known for wanton cruelty.

The following day I shipped to sea with a privateer  
And in the whistle of the wind I could almost hear (oh, oh)

**Chorus**

“There is one thing I must say to you  
As you sail across the sea  
Always, your mother will watch over you  
As you avenge this wicked deed"

And then, that fateful night  
We had you in our sight  
After twenty months at sea  
Your starboard flank abeam  
I was getting my muskets clean  
When came this rumbling from beneath

The ocean shook, the sky went black and the captain quailed  
And before us grew the angry jaws of a giant whale (oh..)

I don't know how I survived  
The crew all was chewed alive  
I must have slipped between his teeth  
But, oh, what providence  
What divine intelligence  
That you should survive  
As well as me

It gives my heart great joy to see your eyes fill with fear  
So lean in close and I will whisper the last words you'll hear  (oh, oh)

# The Mary Ellen Carter {#the-mary-ellen-carter}

## *Stan Rogers*

She went down last October in a pouring driving rain.   
The skipper, he'd been drinking and the Mate, he felt no pain.   
Too close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow,   
And the Mary Ellen Carter settled low.   
There was just us five aboard her when she finally was awash.   
We'd worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost.   
And the groan she gave as she went down, it caused us to proclaim   
That the Mary Ellen Carter would rise again.   
   
Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend.   
She gave twenty years of service, boys, but met her sorry end.   
But insurance paid the loss to us, so let her rest below.   
Then they laughed at us and said we had to go.   
Well we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock,   
For she's worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock.   
And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain   
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again.   
   
**Rise again, rise again, that her name not be lost**   
**To the knowledge of men**  
**Those who loved her best and were with her ‘til the end**  
**Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again**  
   
All spring, now, we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend.   
Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends.   
Thank God it's only sixty feet and the currents here are slow,   
Or I'd never have the strength to go below.   
Well we've patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down.   
Put cables to her, 'fore and aft, and girded her around.   
Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain.   
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again.   
   
For we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale.   
She'd saved our lives so many times, living through the gales,   
And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave—   
They won't be laughing in another day. . .   
And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow,   
With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go,   
Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain,   
And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again.   
   
**Rise again, rise again — though your heart it be broken and life about to end**   
**No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend;**  
**Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again \[x2\]**

# Mary Mac {#mary-mac}

**Mary Mac's mother's making Mary Mac marry me,**  
**My mother's making me marry Mary Mac**  
**I'm gonna marry Mary so that Mary will take care o' me,**  
**Well I’ll be feeling merry when I marry Mary Mac**  
**Do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do**

This little girl, her name is Mary Mac,  
Make no mistake she's the girl I’m gonna track,  
A lot of other fella's want to get her on her back,  
But I'm thinkin' that they'll have to get up early

Now this wee lass, she’s got a lot of class,  
Got a lot of cash, she thinks I'm a gas,  
I'd be a silly ass, to let the matter pass,  
Her father thinks she suits me very fairly

Now Mary and her mother gang an awful lot together,  
In fact you hardly ever see the one without the other,  
And people wonder whether it is Mary or her mother,  
Or both of them together that I'm courtin'

Now the weddin' day 's on Wednesday, and everything's arranged,  
Her name will soon be changed to mine, unless her mind is changed,  
I'm making the arrangements, it’s making me deranged,  
For marriage is an awful undertaking

It's sure to be a grand affair and grander than a fair   
There's going to be a coach and pair for every couple there   
We'll dine upon the finest fare I'm sure to get my share   
If I don't we'll all be very much mistaken

This little girl, her name is Mary Mac,  
Make no mistake she's the girl I’m gonna track,  
A lot of other fella's want to get her on her back,  
But I'm thinkin' that they'll have to get up early

# Mary’s Wedding {#mary’s-wedding}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

**Step we gaily on we go**  
**Heel for heel and toe for toe**  
**Arm and arm and rolling go**  
**All for Mary’s wedding**

Over hill ways up and down  
Myrtle green and bracken brown  
Past the sheeling, through the town  
All for sake of Mary

Red her cheeks as rowans are  
Bright her eye as any star  
Fairest of them all by far  
Is my darling Mary

Plenty herring, plenty meal  
Plenty peat to fill her creel  
Plenty bonny bairns as well  
That’s the toast for Mary

# The Mermaid {#the-mermaid}

## *Traditional. Additional verses by ARRR\!\!\!* 

   
’Twas a Friday morn when we set sail and we were not far from the land   
When our captain, (s)he/they spied, a mer-i-maid so fair with a comb and a spyglass in her hand   
   
**Oh the ocean waves do roll**   
**And the stormy winds do blow**   
**Aye, and we poor sailors are skipping at the top**   
**And the landlubbers lie down, below, below, below**   
**And the landlubbers lie down below**   
 

Well up spoke the captain of our gallant ship, and a fine spoken (wo)man was (s)he/person were they  
“This fishy mermaid has warned me of our doom. We shall sink to the bottom of the sea”   
   
Well up-spoke the mate of our gallant ship, and a dashing young (wo)man was (s)he/person were they  
(S)he says/they say “I have a wife, in Brooklyn by the sea, and to-night a widow she will be”   
   
Well up-spoke the bo’suns of our gallant ship and the spawn of the devil were they   
They say “Man the capstan round boys, haul on the lines. You’ll work to the bottom of the sea”   
   
Well up-spoke the cook of our gallant ship, and a greasy old butcher was (s)he/ were they   
(S)he says/they say “I care much more for my pots and my pans than I do for the bottom of the sea”   
   
Well up-spoke the cabin boy of our gallant ship, and a wretched liddle cabin boy was (s)he/ were they    
(S)he says/they say “I left my fam’ly when I ran-away to sea, and to-night will they all grieve for me”   
   
Well up-spoke the grog-masters of our gallant ship, and old dirty boozers were they  
They-say “Seal-me-in-a-cask for I’d much rather drown in me rum than sober in salt-sea”   
   
Well up spoke the chaplain of our gallant ship, and a pale wizened codger was (s)he/ were they   
(S)he says/they say “You’ve-had your chance now, it’s too late to repent. Laughing at you-all from Heaven I will be”   
   
Well up spoke the booty-master of our gallant ship, and a damn sly capital-ist was (s)he/ were they   
(S)he says/they say “Your deaths shall never settle in my books. In the next life you’re still in debt to me” 

Well up spoke the look-out of our gallant ship, and a keen-eyed sentinel was (s)he/ were they   
(S)he says/they say “I’ve spotted whales and warships, but never mer i maids, who knows what in the next life I will see”

Well one time ’round spun our gallant ship, and two times ’round went she   
Then three times ’round spun our gallant ship and she sank to the bottom of the sea

# Mingulay Boat Song {#mingulay-boat-song}

   
**Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys,**   
**Heave her head ‘round into the weather**   
**Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys,**   
**Sailing homeward to Mingulay**   
   
What care we how white the minch is   
What care we for the wind and weather   
For we know that every inch is   
Sailing closer to Mingulay   
   
Wives are waiting at the pierhead   
Looking seaward into the weather   
Heave her ‘round, boys, and we’ll anchor   
E’er the sun sets on Mingulay   
   
Far beyond the straits of Cooley,   
We can see our own land of heather,   
And you know, boys, candles glow, boys   
Lighting the windows of Mingulay   
   
*(optional)*  
*Ships return now, heavy laden*   
*Mothers holdin’ their bairns a-cryin’*   
*We’ll return though, when the sun sets,*   
*We’ll return then to Mingulay*

# The Minstrel Boy {#the-minstrel-boy}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

The minstrel boy to war is gone  
In the ranks of death you will find him  
His father’s sword he hath girded on  
And his wild harp slung behind him  
“Land of Song\!” cried the warrior bard  
“Tho’ every man betray thee  
One sword, at least, thy ranks shall guard  
One faithful harp shall praise thee\!”

The Minstrel fell, but the foeman’s steel  
Could not bring that proud soul under  
The harp he loved ne’er spoke again  
For he tore its chords asunder  
And said, “No chains shall sully thee  
Thou soul of love and bravery\!  
Thy songs were made for the pure and free  
They shall never sound in slavery\!”[^14]

# Molasses {#molasses}

## *Tom Rowe*

# 

Oh, the African man cuts the sugar cane  
**Oh, molasses**  
He works in the sun and he works in the rain  
**Oh, molasses rum**  
Then he loads it up on a wooden ship and he sends it off on a northern trip  
**Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum**  
   
**Oh, molasses**  
**Old New England tea**  
**It killed my grandpa, killed my pa**  
**And it sure as Hell is killing me**  
**Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum**  
   
When they fought the war for the colonies…  
They fought it over New England tea…  
When Old King George put a tax on it the colonies nearly took a fit…  
   
In the time of the 1917 war  
Molasses sitting on the Boston shore  
When they pumped it in it was twelve degrees, a long cold night in a Boston freeze  
In the morning it was 42  
Molasses vat split clean in two  
Two million gallons covered the bay, 26 people drowned in the flood that day  
   
My grandpa he died cutting cane  
My pa went down in the great brown rain  
But I won’t go in a pool of blood; no I won’t drown in a black-strap flood  
**Still, I’ll go down to molasses, oh molasses rum**

# Morning Glory  {#morning-glory}

   
**One for the *Morning Glory***   
**Two for the sweet brown brew**   
**Three for the man who’ll stand his round**   
**And four for the love of you, me girls**   
**Four for the love of you**   
   
At the end of the day I like a couple drinks when I raise up my voice and sing   
An hour or two with the fine brown brew and I’m ready for anything   
At the Cross Keys Inn there were sisters four, the landlord’s daughters fair   
And every night when they turned out the light they would lead me up the stairs.  
   
I got the call from foreign shores to go and fight the foe   
And I thought no more of the sisters four though they cried to see me go   
I sailed away on a ship, the *Morning Glory* was her name   
We’d all fall down when the rum went round, then get up and drink again   
   
I bore once more to my native shore, farewell to the raging main   
The Cross Keys Inn, it was beckoning, with the rum to ease my pain   
But there on the shore were the sisters four with a bundle upon each knee   
There were three little girls and a bouncing boy and they all looked just like me

# Morning Shanty  {#morning-shanty}

   
Won't you come down to the shore

We have sung through half the night  
**Watching**  
For the coming of the light  
**In the morning**

For the friends who now have gone  
**Watching**  
For the friends returning home  
**In the morning**

But the clock upon the wall  
**Watching**  
Steals the time and gives it all  
**To the morning**

At my window I will be  
**Watching**  
For your ships to sail to me  
**In the morning**

**Aye a-diddlee aye dul dum[^15]**  
**Diddlee oodle aye dul dum**  
**Diddlee doo rye diddlee aye ay** *\[x2\]*

Let grasses grow and water flow in a free and easy way  
Just give me enough of the rare old stuff that’s grown near Galway Bay  
The police men from old Donegal, Sligo and Lietrim, too  
We’ll give them the slip and we’ll take a sip of the rare old mountain dew

At the foot of the hill there’s a neat little still where the smoke curls up to the sky  
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell there’s poitin[^16] brewing nearby  
It fills the air with odor rare, but betwixt both me and you  
When home we go you can take a bowl or a bucket of the mountain dew

Now learned men who use the pen have wrote your praises high  
That sweet poitin from Ireland green is stilled from wheat and rye  
Put away your pills, it’ll cure all ills, whether Pagan or Christian or Jew  
Take off your coat and grease your throat with a bucket of the mountain dew

**Whiskey whiskey, Nancy-O\!**

I am a weaver, a Carlton weaver,  
I am a brash and a roving blade,  
I got silver in my britches,  
And I follow the roving trade

I went into Glasgow city,  
Nancy Whiskey I did smell,  
I walked in, sat down beside her,  
Seven long years; I loved her well

The more I kissed her, the more I knew her,  
The more I loved her, the more she smiled,  
I forgot my mother's teaching,  
Nancy soon had me beguiled\!

Woke up early in the morning,  
Lying halfway off the bed,  
Tried to rise, but I was not able,  
Nancy damn near knocked me dead\!

I'll get back to the Carlton weaving,  
Surely make those shuttles fly,  
I'll make more at the Carlton weaving,  
Than ever I did at the roving way

All you weavers, you Carlton weavers,  
All you weavers where e'er you be,  
Beware of whiskey, Nancy Whiskey,  
She'll ruin you as she ruined me\!

# The Night that Paddy Murphy Died {#the-night-that-paddy-murphy-died}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

Oh, the night that Paddy Murphy died is a night I’ll never forget  
Some of the boys got loaded drunk, and they ain’t been sober yet  
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feeling gay  
O’Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play

**That’s how they showed their respect for Paddy Murphy**  
**That’s how they showed their honor and their pride**  
**They said it was a sin and shame and they winked at one another**  
**And every drink in the place was full the night Pat Murphy died**

As Mrs. Murphy sat in the corner pouring out her grief  
Kelly and his gang came tearing down the street  
They went into an empty room and a bottle of whiskey stole  
They put the bottle with the corpse to keep that whiskey cold

About two o’clock in the morning after emptying the jug  
Doyle rolls up the icebox lid to see poor Paddy’s mug  
We stopped the clock so Mrs. Murphy couldn’t tell the time  
And at a quarter after two we argued it was nine

They stopped the hearse on George Street outside some damn saloon  
They all went in at half past eight and staggered out at noon  
They went up to the graveyard, so holy and sublime  
Found out when they got there, they’d left the corpse behind

Oh, the night that Paddy Murphy died is a night I’ll never forget  
Some of the boys got loaded drunk and they ain’t been sober yet  
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feeling gay  
O’Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play

# The North Sea Shoals {#the-north-sea-shoals}

## *From Tripple Nipple Jones*

Come all you gallant fishermen that plough the stormy sea,  
The whole year round on the fishing grounds  
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.

It's there you'll find the Norfolk boys and the lads from Peterhead,  
There's Buckie chiels and men from Shields,  
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.

From Fraserborough and Aberdeen, from Whitby, Yarmouth Town,  
The fleet's away at the break of day  
To the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
To the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.

It's off with a boiler full of steam and your engine spic and span  
To fish the grounds the North Sea round  
And fish and knolls and the North Sea Holes  
And try your luck at the North Shields Gut  
With a catch of a hundred cran.

No need to wait for the wind and tide, you're the master of the sea,  
Come calm or squall, just shoot and haul  
And fill the hold with the fish to be sold  
And steam ahead for the curing shed  
And the buyers on the Yarmouth quay.

Come all you gallant fishermen that plough the stormy sea,  
The whole year round on the fishing grounds

# Northwest Passage  {#northwest-passage}

## *Stan Rogers* 

   
 **Ah for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage[^17]**   
 **To find the hand of Franklin[^18] reaching for the Beaufort Sea**   
 **Tracing one warm line, through a land so wide and ravaged.[^19]**  
 **And make a Northwest Passage to the sea**   
   
Westward through the Davis Strait ‘tis there ‘twas said to lie   
The sea route to the western coast for which so many died   
Come seeking gold and glory, leaving weathered broken bones   
And a long forgotten lonely cairn of stones   
   
Three centuries thereafter, I take passage overland   
In the footsteps of brave Kelso[^20], where his sea of flowers began   
Watching cities rise before me, then behind me sink again   
This tardiest explorer driving hard across the plain   
   
And through the night, behind the wheel, the mileage clicking west   
I think upon MacKenzie[^21], David Thompson[^22] and the rest   
Who cracked the mountain ramparts and did show a path for me   
To race the roaring Fraser to the sea   
   
How then am I so different from the first men through this way?   
Like them I left a settled life, I threw it all away   
To seek a Northwest Passage at the call of many men   
To find there but the road back home again

# Oak and Ash and Thorn {#oak-and-ash-and-thorn}

## *From Lord Fjordinand the Firth*

Of all the trees that grow so fair,  
Old Engerland to adorn,  
Greater are none beneath the Sun,  
Than Oak and Ash and Thorn.

**Sing Oak and Ash and Thorn, good sirs**  
**All on a midsummer’s morn\!**  
**Surely we sing of no little thing,**  
**In Oak and Ash and Thorn\!**

Oak of the Clay lived many a day,  
Or ever Aeneas began;  
Ash of the Loam was a lady at home,  
When Brut was an outlaw man;  
Thorn of the Down saw New Troy Town  
From which was London born  
Witness hereby the ancientry  
Of Oak and Ash and Thorn\!

Yew that is old in churchyard mold,  
He breedeth a mighty bow;  
Alder for shoes do wise men choose,  
And beech for cups also.  
But when ye have killed, and your bowl it is spilled,  
And your shoes are clean outworn,  
Back ye must speed for all that ye need,  
To Oak and Ash and Thorn\!

Elm she hates mankind, and waits  
Till every gust be laid,  
To drop a limb on the head of him  
That anyway trusts her shade:  
But whether a lad be sober or sad,  
Or mellow with ale from the horn,  
He’ll take no wrong when he lieth along  
’Neath Oak and Ash and Thorn\!

Oh, do not tell the Priest our plight, Or he would call it a sin, But we’ve been out in the woods all night, A-conjuring Summer in\! We bring you good news by word of mouth Good news for cattle and corn Sure as the Sun come up from the South, With Oak and Ash and Thorn\!

# The Old Churchyard

## *From The Watersons’ 2002 album A Dark Light*

Come, come with me out to the old churchyard,  
I so well know those paths 'neath the soft green sward.  
Friends slumber in there that we want to regard;  
We will trace out their names in the old churchyard.

Mourn not for them, their trials are o'er,  
And why weep for those who will weep no more?  
For sweet is their sleep, though cold and hard  
Their pillows may be in the old churchyard.

I know that it's vain when our friends depart  
To breathe kind words to a broken heart;  
And I know that the joy of life is marred  
When we follow lost friends to the old churchyard.

But were I at rest 'neath yonder tree,  
Oh, why would you weep, my friends, for me?  
I'm so weary, so wayworn, why would you retard  
The peace I seek is in the old churchyard?

Why weep for me, for I'm anxious to go  
To that haven of rest where no tears ever flow;  
And I fear not to enter that dark lonely tomb  
Where our saviour has lain and conquered the gloom.

I rest in the hope that one bright day  
Sunshine will burst to these prisons of clay,  
And old Gabriel's trumpet and voice of the Lord  
Will wake up the dead in the old churchyard.

# Old Dun Cow {#old-dun-cow}

Some friends and I in a public house were playin’ dominoes one night  
When into the room a barman came, his face all chalky white   
“What’s up,” says Brown, “Have you seen a ghost? Have you seen your Aunt Mariah?”  
“Oh me Aunt Mariah be buggered,” said he, “The bloody pub’s on fire\!”

“Oh” says Brown, “what a bit o’ luck, everybody follow me  
It’s down to the cellar, if the fire’s not there, we’ll have a grand old spree\!”  
So we all went down with good old Brown, and the booze we could not miss,  
And we hadn’t been there ten minutes or more ‘til we were quite like this: oh

**There was Brown, upside down, moppin’ up the whiskey on the floor,**  
**“Booze\! Booze\!” the firemen cried, as they came a-knockin’ at the door;**  
**Oh don’t let ‘em in ‘til it’s all drunk up, somebody shouted “MacIntyre\!” (MacIntyre\!\!\!)**  
**And we all got blue-blind, paralytic drunk when the Old Dun Cow caught fire**.

Then Smith went over to the port wine tub and gave it just two hard knocks,  
Started takin’ off his pantaloons, likewise his shoes and socks;  
“Hold on,” says Brown, “That ain’t allowed, you can’t do that in here\!  
Don’t be washing your trousers in the port wine tub when we’ve got lite ‘Gansett beer\!”

Oh, then there came a mighty crash, half the bloody roof caved in,  
We were drownin’ in the fireman’s hose, though I swear it tastes like gin,  
So we got some tacks and some old wet sacks, and we tacked ourselves inside,  
And we sat there drinking pints of stout ‘til we were bleary-eyed. 

# Old King Coal {#old-king-coal}

*John Kirkpatrick*

Under the ground lay Old King Coal  
He lay most peacefully  
He ruled in might and splendour  
There was none so grand as he  
But men came along to tunnel him out  
And topple him from his throne  
They tore him down to steal his crown  
For the power in the old black stone.

**There's fire in the heart of Old King Coal**  
**There's the strength of centuries in his soul**  
**There's a power that grows where his black blood flows**  
**So here's to Old King Coal.**

So they scratched him, hacked him, and harried him out  
They ripped him from his bed  
And they blasted his bones asunder  
They'd sworn to see him dead  
Then they carried him out to the sun's bright light  
Which blinded him in the eye  
And the blood did drain from every vein  
Until they'd drained him dry.

Then they cracked his bones on the grinding stones  
How gleefully they did grind  
Oh how they pulverized him  
Turned him to dust so fine  
Then they sprayed him into the furnace fire  
And burned him in the air  
With a mighty blast they burned him fast  
As he prayed his final prayer.

And his soul cried out with a final song  
As he reached his final hour  
And his heart it burst with singing  
So mighty was the power  
And he sang the water into steam  
And the steam made the wheels fly round  
And the song ran on both pure and strong  
Till the wires hummed with its sound.

Out of the darkness there comes light  
Out of the earth comes fire  
Out of the cold comes comfort  
As his bones go blazing higher  
And his soul flies out through the air we breathe  
And down on the earth we tread  
That humankind may not forget  
That Old King Coal is dead.

# Old Turf Fire {#old-turf-fire}

**Oh the old turf fire**  
**And the hearth swept clean**  
**Sure there's no one half so happy**  
**As meself and Paddy Keane**  
**With the baby in the cradle**  
**You can hear her mammy say**  
**Ah wouldn't you go to sleep Alanna**  
**‘Til I wet your Daddy's tea[^23].**

Oh I've got a little house  
And a tidy bit of land  
Sure you'd never see the better  
On this side of Cnoc na gCrann[^24]  
I've no piano in the corner  
And no pictures on the wall  
Ah but sure I'm quite contented  
In me little marble hall.

Oh the man that I work for  
Is a richer man than me  
But somehow I'll be telling you  
We never can agree.  
He has big towering mansions  
And he's castles over all  
But sure I'd never exchange with him  
Me little marble hall

Oh the old turf fire  
What a welcome now it brings  
As the cricket chirrups gaily  
And the kettle also sings  
We all join in the chorus  
Of a merry lilting song  
With the friendly neighbours dropping in  
To join in the happy throng.

Round the old turf fire  
Sit the old folk bent with years  
As they watch us tripping lightly  
And they're smilin' through their tears  
For so sadly they are dreaming  
Of their youthful hearts desire  
And those dear old days so long ago  
Round the old turf fire

# P Stands For Paddy {#p-stands-for-paddy}

As went out one fine morning  
For to take a little walk  
I sat myself down by an old stone wall  
To hear two lovers talk.  
To hear two lovers talk, me love  
To hear what they might say  
That I might learn a little of love before I go away.

**And ‘P’ stands for Paddy, I suppose**  
**‘J’ for my love John**   
**And ‘W’ stands for false Willy-o**   
**But Johnny is the fairest man.**  
**Oh, Johnny is the fairest man, she cried**  
**Johnny is the fairest man**  
**Oh I don’t care what anybody says, for Johnny is the fairest man.**

Oh I won’t sit beside you, love,  
Not now or any other time  
For you, you love another pretty maid  
And your heart’s no longer mine.  
Your heart’s no longer mine, she cried  
You heart’s no longer mine  
For you, you love another pretty maid and your heart’s no longer mine.

Well I will climb a high high tree   
And rob a little bird’s nest  
And I will take whatever I can find   
To the arms I love the best.  
To the arms I love the best, she cried  
The arms I love the best  
Oh, I will take whatever I can find to the arms I love the best.

# Paddy Doyle’s Boots  {#paddy-doyle’s-boots}

   
**To me way, ay, ay, ay, ay, ah\!**   
We’ll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots   
   
We’ll all throw mud at the cook   
   
That dirty old man on the poop   
   
We’ll all drink whiskey and gin   
   
We’ll all shave under our chin   
   
We’ll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots

# Paddy’s Lament {#paddy’s-lament}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

# 

Well it's by the hush, me boys, and that’s to mind your noise  
And listen to poor Paddy's sad narration  
For I was by hunger pressed, and in poverty distressed  
So I took a thought to leave the Irish nation

Hear me, boys, now take my advice  
To America I'll have ye not be going  
There is nothing here but war, where the murderin' cannons roar  
And I wish I was at home in dear old Dublin

Well I sold me horse and cow, my little pigs and sow  
My father’s plot of land I soon departed  
And me sweetheart Bidd McGee, I'm afraid I'll never see  
For I left her there that morning broken-hearted

Well meself and a hundred more, to America sailed o'er  
Our fortunes to be makin’ we were thinkin'  
But when we got to Yankee land, they shoved a gun into our hands  
Saying, "Paddy, you must go and fight for Lincoln"

General Meagher to us he said, if you get shot or lose your head  
Every mother’s son of you will get a pension  
Well in the war I lost me leg; all I have’s this wooden peg,  
And by God this is the truth to you I mention

Well I think meself in luck, if I’m fed on wheat of buck  
And old Ireland is the country I delight in  
With the devil, I do say, it's curse Americay  
For I think I've had enough of your hard fightin’

# The Parting Glass {#the-parting-glass}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

Oh, all the money that e’er I spent, I spent it in good company  
And all the harm that e’er I’ve done, alas, it was to none but me  
And all I’ve done for want of wit to mem’ry now I can’t recall  
So fill to me the parting glass, good night and joy be with you all

Oh, all the comrades that e’er I’ve had, they are sorry for my going away  
And all the sweethearts that e’er I’ve had, would wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not  
I’ll gently rise and I’ll softly call good night and joy be with you all  
Good night, and joy be with you all

# The Peat Fire Flame {#the-peat-fire-flame}

## *From The Whip\!*

Far away and o'er the moor,  
Morar waits for a boat that saileth,  
Far away down Lowland way,  
I dream the dream I learned, lad,

**By the light o' the peat-fire flame,**  
**Light for love, for lilt o' laughter,**  
**By the light o' the peat-fire flame,**  
**The light the hill-folk yearn for.**

Far away, down Lowland way,  
Grim's the toil, without tune or dream, lad,  
All you need's a creel and love,  
For the dream the heart can weave, lad

Far away the tramp and tread,  
Tune and laughter of all the heroes,  
Pulls me onward o'er the trail  
Of the dream my heart may weave, lad.,

# The Pirates Who Don’t Do Anything {#the-pirates-who-don’t-do-anything}

## *From Vitamin Seal*

**We are the pirates we don't do anything**  
**We just stay at home and lie around**  
**And if you ask us to do anything**  
**We'll just tell you, we don't do anything**

Well I've never been to Greenland, and I've never been to Denver  
And I've never buried treasure in St. Louis or St. Paul  
And I've never been to Moscow, and I've never been to Tampa  
And I've never been to Boston in the fall

And I've never hoist the main sail, and I've never swabbed the poop deck  
And I've never veered starboard 'cause I've never sailed at all  
And I've never walked the gang plank, and I've never owned a parrot  
And I've never been to Boston in the fall

Oh, I've never plucked a rooster and I am not too good at ping-pong  
And I've never thrown my mashed potatoes up against the wall  
And I've never kissed a chipmunk, and I've never gotten head lice  
And I have never been to Boston in the fall  
Pirate captains log 2002 who'll be this band Relient K  
And why they'll be so full of contradictions  
We don't know what he did but we're down with Captain Kidd  
We don't wake up before lunch but we all eat Captain Crunch  
We don't smoke, we don't chew, we watch Captain Kangaroo  
{Ladies and gentlemen let's give them a big hand}

# A Professional Pirate {#a-professional-pirate}

## *From Muppet Treasure Island*

When I was just a lad looking for my true vocation    
My father said "Now son, this choice deserves deliberation    
Though you could be a doctor or perhaps a financier    
My boy why not consider a more challenging career"    
   
Hey ho ho    
You'll cruise to foreign shores    
And you'll keep your mind and body sound    
By working out of doors    
True friendship and adventure are what we can't live without    
And when you're a professional pirate    
That's what the job's about   
    
Now take Sir Francis Drake, the Spanish all despise him    
But to the British he's a hero and they idolize him    
It's how you look at buccaneers that makes them bad or good    
And I see us as members of a noble brotherhood    
   
Hey ho ho    
We're honorable men    
And before we lose our tempers we will always count to ten    
On occasion there may be someone you have to execute    
But when you’re a professional pirate    
You don't have to wear a suit.....what?    
 

I could have been a surgeon    
I like taking things apart    
   
I could have been a lawyer    
But I just had too much heart    
   
I could have been in politics    
Cause I've always been a big spender    
   
And me...I could have been a contender    
   
Some say that pirates steal and should be feared and hated    
I say we're victims of bad press it's all exaggerated    
We'd never stab you in the back, we'd never lie or cheat    
We're just about the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet    
   
Hey ho ho    
It's one for all for one    
And we'll share and share alike with you and love you like a son    
We're gentlemen of fortune and that's what we're proud to be    
And when you’re a professional pirate    
You'll be honest brave and free    
The soul of decency    
You'll be loyal and fair and on the square    
And most importantly    
When you're a professional pirate    
You're always in the best of company

# Pull Down Below {#pull-down-below}

   
I went to church and I went to chapel  
**Pull down below\!**  
I went to church and I went to chapel  
**Pull down below\!**

**Oh, Hieland Laddie**  
**Pull down below\!**  
**Hieland laddie, bonny laddie**  
**Pull down below\!**

Out on the road I found a saddle  
I found a saddle and an empty poke

I found a saddle and an empty poke  
But where the hell is the bleedin' moke

The moke is gone and I'll go too  
I'll sail away to Backaloo

Oh, hoist 'er up and away we'll go  
Hoist 'er up from down below

Oh, giver 'er sheet and let 'er go  
We're outward bound to Backalow

I thought I heard the Old Man say  
It's one more pull and then belay

# Pump Shanty  {#pump-shanty}

**Pump me boys, pump her dry**   
**Down to hell and up to the sky**   
**Bend your back and break your bones**   
**We’re just a thousand miles from home**   
   
They say life has its ups and downs   
That really now is quite profound   
I’d like to push the capstan round   
But it’s pump me boys before we drown   
   
The captain's daughter I suppose   
Could be called an English Rose   
What would you think when I propose   
The pox she gave to me a dose.   
   
This rose well she did prick me sore   
I never felt so bad before   
Thanks to the girl I do adore   
I thought I'd never pump no more.   
   
I called the doctor right away   
To find out what he had to say   
That's two pounds ten, get on your way   
I'm sure this girl is in his pay.   
   
Sometimes while lying in me bed   
And thinking of me day ahead   
I wish that I could wake up dead   
But pumpin's all I get instead   
   
The ocean we all do adore    
So come on lads let's pump some more   
Don't worry if you’re stiff and sore   
I'm sure we've pumped this bit before..   
   
There's so much water down below    
Just how it got there I don't know   
The old man says let's roll and go   
But I think we're bound for Davey Jones.

# Ranzo Reuben {#ranzo-reuben}

*From Barefoot the Bootless*

Oh Ranzo was no sailor  
**Ranzo me boys, Ranzo**  
He shipped aboard a whaler   
**Ranzo me boys, Ranzo**

He shipped with Captain Taylor   
The man who shot the sailor

He couldn’t do his duty  
So they gave him lashes thirty

The skipper’s daugher Suzy  
She begged her dad for mercy

She gave him wine and water  
And a little more than she ought’a 

He got his first mate’s papers  
Now he’s Captain of a Whaler

# Rambling Soldier {#rambling-soldier}

I am a soldier, I do say  
That rambles for promotion  
 I’ve laid the French and the Spaniards low   
Some miles upon the ocean  
Come, now me jolly boys,  
I bid you all adieu  
No more to the wars will I go with you  
But I’ll ramble the country through and through   
And I’ll be a rambling solider

The King he has commanded me   
To range this country over  
From Woolwich up to Liverpool  
And from Plymouth back to Dover  
And in whatever town I went,  
To court all damsels I was bent,  
And to marry none was my intent,  
But live a rambling soldier.

And when these wars are at an end  
I’m not afraid to mention  
The King will hand me my discharge,  
A guinea and a pension  
No doubt some lassies will me blame  
But none of them will know my name  
And if you want to know the same  
My name is Rambling Soldier

… And they call me a rambling soldier

I'm a son of a sea cook; I'm a cook and a trader  
I can dance, I can sing, I can reef the main boom  
I can handle a jigger, I cuts a fine figure  
Whenever I gets in a boat standing room

Oderin and Presque, Fox Hole and Bruley  
I'm bound for the westward to the wall with the hole in  
I can't marry all or a chokey I'll be

# Red-Haired Mary {#red-haired-mary}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

While going to the fair of Dingle  
One fine morning last July  
When going down the road before me  
A red-haired girl I chanced to spy

I went to her, said, “aye, young lady,  
My donkey he will carry two  
And seeing how you have no donkey  
To the Dingle fair I’ll ride with you”

Now when we reached the town of Dingle  
I took her hand to say goodbye  
When a tinker man stepped up beside me  
And he belted me in my left eye

**Keep your hands off red-haired Mary**  
**Her and I will soon be wed**  
**We’ll see the priest this very morning**  
**Tonight we’ll lie in a marriage bed**

Now I was feeling kinda peevish  
And me poor old eye was sad and sore  
And I gently tapped him with my hobnails  
And he flew back through Murphy’s door

A policeman came around the corner  
And he told me I had broke the law  
When the donkey kicked him in the kneecap  
And he fell down and broke his jaw

Then he went off to find his brother  
The biggest man you ever did see  
He gently tapped me with his knuckles  
And I was minus two front teeth

Now the red-haired girl she kept on smiling  
“I’ll go with you, young man,” she said  
“We’ll forget the priest this very morning  
And tonight we’ll lie in Murphy’s shed”

**Keep your hands off red-haired Mary**  
**Her and I will soon be wed**  
**We’ll forget the priest this very morning**  
**Tonight we’ll lie in Murphy’s shed**

Now through the fair we rode together  
My black eye and her red hair  
Smiling gaily at the tinkers  
And my God we were a handsome pair\!

## *From Chase the Wild Goose*

Come over the hills, my bonnie Irish lass  
Come over the hills to your darling  
You choose the road, love, and I'll make the vow  
And I'll be your true love forever

**Red is the rose that in yonder garden grows**  
**Fair is the lily of the valley**  
**Clear is the water that flows from the Boyne**  
**But my love is fairer than any**

'Twas down by Killarney's green woods that we strayed  
When the moon and the stars they were shining  
The moon shone its rays on her locks of golden hair  
And she swore she'd be my love forever

It's not for the parting that my sister pains  
It's not for the grief of my mother  
It's all for the loss of my bonny Irish lass  
That my heart is breaking forever

Red is the rose that in yonder garden grows  
Fair is the lily of the valley  
Clear is the water that flows from the Boyne  
But my love is fairer than any

**Then away, love, away**  
**Oh\! You Rio\!**  
**Sing fare-ye-well to my pretty young girl**  
**And we’re bound for the Rio Grande**

This old New York town is no place for me  
I’ll pack up my sea-chest and get off to sea

Now all you beach comers we’ll have you to know  
We’re bound for the south’ard and glad for to go

So it’s put down your bag and get it unpacked  
The sooner we leave here the quicker we’re back

There’s some of us sick and there’s some of us sore  
We’ve scoffed all our whack and we’re looking for more

Our ship went sailing out over the bar  
We pointed her nose towards the southern star

Them Liverpool judies they never use combs  
They comb out their locks with a haddock’s backbone

Cheer up Mary Ellen an’ don’t look so glum  
On white stockin’ day ye’ll be drinkin’ hot rum

But we don’t like the grub, no I’m damned if we do

## *From Corvis the Nightterror*

And come tell me Sean O'Farrell, tell me why you hurry so  
Hush mbhuachaill[^27], hush and listen and his cheeks were all aglow  
I bear orders from the captain, get you ready quick and soon  
**For the pikes must be together at the rising of the moon**

**At the rising of the moon, at the rising of the moon**  
**For the pikes must be together at the rising of the moon**

And come tell me Sean O'Farrell, where the gathering is to be  
At the old spot by the river quite well known to you and me  
One more word for signal token, whistle out the marching tune  
**With your pike upon your shoulder at the rising of the moon**

Out from many a mud walled cabin eyes were watching through the night  
Many a manly heart was beating for the blessed morning's light  
Murmurs ran along the valley to the banshee's lonely croon  
**And a thousand pikes were flashing by the rising of the moon**

All along that singing river, that black mass of men was seen  
High above their shining weapons flew their own beloved green  
Death to every foe and traitor, whistle out the marching tune

**And hoorah me boys for freedom 'tis the rising of the moon** 

# The Rocky Road To Dublin

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

In the merry month of June from my home I started  
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken-hearted  
Saluted me Father dear, kissed me darlin’ Mother  
Drank a pint of beer, my grief and tears to smother  
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born  
I cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins  
Bought a pair of brogues, rattlin’ o’er the bogs  
And frightened all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

**One, two, three, four, five\!**  
**Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road**  
**All the way to Dublin, whack fol-lol-de-ra**

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary  
Started by daylight next morning bright and airy  
Took a drop of the pure to keep my heart from sinking  
That’s the Paddy’s cure, whene’er he’s on for drinking  
To see the lassies smile, laughing all the while  
At my curious style, ’twould set your heart a-bubbling  
Asked if I was hired, wages I required  
’Till I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity  
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city  
So then I took a stroll out among the quality  
My bundle it was stolen in a neat locality  
Something crossed my mind, when I looked behind  
No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin’  
Enquiring for the rogue, found me Connaught brogue  
Wasn’t much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

From there I got away, me spirits never failing  
Landed on the quay just as the ship was sailing  
The captain at me roared, said that no room had he  
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy  
Down among the pigs, played some funny rigs  
Danced some hearty jigs, the water ’round me bubbling  
When off Holyhead, wished meself was dead  
Or better far, instead, on the rocky road to Dublin

The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed  
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it  
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing  
Poor old Erin’s isle they began abusing  
“Hurrah me soul\!” says I, shillelagh I let fly  
Some Galway boys were nigh, they saw I was a-hobblin’  
With a loud “Hurray\!” they joined in the affray  
We quickly cleared the way, for the rocky road to Dublin

# Roll Down {#roll-down}

Sweet ladies of Ply-mouth, we bid you good-bye,

**Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down**

**And we will roll-oll, roll-oll-oll down,**  
**Walk a-round, me brave boys, and roll down\!**

The anchor's away and the sails are unfurled,  
We're bound for to sail her halfway 'round the world,

In the deep Bay of Biscay the seas do run high,  
Them poor weary transports they'll wish they could die,

When the great southern whales on our quarter do spout,  
Them poor weary transports, they'll goggle and shout,

When at last we draw near to Australia's bold strand,  
Them poor weary transports, they'll long for the land,

Then, sweet ladies of Plymouth, we'll pay all your rent,  
And go roving no more till our money's all spent.

# Roll The Woodpile Down {#roll-the-woodpile-down}

Oh way down south where the cocks do crow  
**Way down in Florida**  
Them girls all dance to the old banjo  
**And we’ll roll the woodpile down\!**

**Rollin’\! Rollin’\! Rollin’\! Rollin’\!**   
**Rollin’ the whole world ‘round**  
**That girl of mine on the Georgia Line**  
**And we’ll roll the woodpile down\!**

We’ll roll him high and we’ll roll him low  
We’ll heave him up and away we’ll go

Oh, roust and bust her is the cry  
A sailor’s wage is never high

O Curly goes on the ol’ ran-tan  
O Curly’s jist a Down-East man

Oh one more heave and that’ll do  
For we’re the bullies to kick her through

If all the young lassies were locks on a gate   
Then I’d be the key to insert and rotate   
   
If all the young lassies were boats on the ocean    
Then I’d be the waves and I’d show ’em the motion 

If all the young lassies were telephone poles   
Then I’d be the squirrel to crack nuts in their holes   
   
If all the young lassies were sheep in the clover   
Then I’d ram and I’d ram and I’d ram ’em all over   
   
If all the young lassies were winds of the sea   
Then I’d be a sail and I’d let them blow me   
   
If all the young laddies were pipes in the yard   
Then after I drained ’em they’d still remain hard   
   
If laddies were watches in shiny gold cases   
Then I’d be the hands and I’d sit on their faces   
   
If all the young laddies were camels to pack   
I'd hump them all day, and I'd never spit back   
   
If all the young laddies were coconuts sweet   
Then I’d suck out their juices and chew on their meat   
   
If all the young laddies were needles and pins   
Then I’d be cushion to hold their pricks in   
   
If all the young laddies were puppies full grown   
Then I’d be the ground where they’d bury their bone   
   
If all the young laddies were singing this song   
It’d be over too quick and it’d be half as long

# Rollin’ Down to Old Maui {#rollin’-down-to-old-maui}

## *The first song the crew ever forgot during a show*

   
It’s a damn tough life full of toil and strife we whalermen undergo   
And we don’t give a damn when the whaling’s done how hard the winds did blow   
‘Cause we’re homeward bound from the Arctic Ground with a good ship taut and free   
And we won’t give a damn when we drink our rum on the shores of old Maui   
   
**Rollin’ down to old Maui, me boys, rollin’ down to old Maui**   
**We’re homeward bound from the Arctic Ground, rollin’ down to old Maui**   
   
Once more we sail with the northerly gale through the ice and wind and rain   
Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands, we soon shall see again   
Six hellish months we’ve passed away on the cold Kamchatka Sea,   
But now we’re bound from the Arctic Ground, rollin’ down to old Maui   
   
Once more we sail with the northerly gale towards our island home   
Our main mast sprung, our whaling done, and we ain’t got far to roam   
Our stuns’l boom’s been carried away, what care we for that sound   
A living gale is after us, thank God we’re homeward bound

**When I die, bury me low,**  
**Where I can hear the bonny Tweed flow,**  
**A sweeter place I never did know,**  
**The rolling hills o’ the border**

I have travelled far and wide,  
Seen the Hudson and seen the Clyde,  
I’ve courted by Loch Lomond’s side  
But I dearly love the border

Often I have mind o’ the day  
With my lass, I strolled by the Tay,  
But all its beauty fades away  
Among the hills o’ the border

There’s a certain peace of mind  
Bonnie lasses there you’ll find  
Men so sturdy, men so kind  
Among the hills of the border

When I'm dead and laid out on the counter  
A voice you will hear from below,

Then get a half-dozen stout fellows  
And stack them all up in a row  
**Let them drink out of half-gallon bottles**  
**To the memory of Rosin the Beau**

Then get a half-dozen stout fellows  
And let them all stagger and go  
**And dig a great hole in the meadow**  
**And in it put Rosin the Beau.**

Then get ye a couple of bottles;  
Put one at me head and me toe.  
**With a diamond ring scratch upon 'em**  
**The name of old Rosin the Beau.**

I feel that old tyrant approaching,  
That cruel and remorseless old foe,  
**And I lift up me glass in his honor,**  
**Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau.**

Clouds are upon the summer sky   
There's thunder in the wind   
Pull on, pull on, and homeward hie   
Nor give one look behind   
   
**Row on, row on, another day**   
**May shine with brighter light**   
**Ply, ply the oars and pull away**   
**There’s dawn beyond the night**   
   
Bear where thou goest the words of love   
Say all that words can say   
Changeless affection, strength to prove   
But speed upon the way   
   
Like yonder river would I glide   
To where my heart would be   
My barque should soon out-sail the tide   
That hurries to the sea   
   
But yet a star shines constant still   
Through yonder cloudy sky   
And hope as bright my bosom fills   
From faith that cannot die   
   
Row on, row on, God speed the way   
Thou must not linger here   
Storms hang about the closing day   
Tomorrow may be clear

**Hey, the last boat’s a-leaving**  
By the shore at Pieta  
**Call away the di-so**

And my real love, she was there  
There was sand all in her hair

How did sand get in your hair  
Darling Johnny put it there

Been with Johnny all the day  
Down at Ghajn Tuffheija Bay

He’s a better man by far  
Because he’s got a Yankee car

I went out from Sammy’s Bar  
Had to hire a Yankee car

Fourteen days I drank no wine  
Saving for that love of mine

Then one day in Paula square  
At a paper I did stare

Johnny tried a hairpin bend  
For my love, it was the end

Going back to Sammy’s Bar

# Saucy Sailor {#saucy-sailor}

Come me own one, come me fair one  
Come now unto me  
Could ye fancy a poor sailor lad   
Who has just come from the sea?

Oh you’re ragged, love, and you’re dirty, love  
And your clothes smell much of tar  
So be gone you saucy sailor lad  
So be gone you Jack Tar

If I’m ragged, love, and I’m dirty, love  
And me clothes smell much of tar  
I have silver in me pocket, love  
And gold in great store

And then when she heard him say so  
On her bended knees she fell:  
I will marry my dear Henry,  
For I love the sailor lads so well\!

Do you think that I, I am foolish love?  
Do you think that I am mad?  
For to wed with a poor country girl  
Where no fortune’s to be had?

I will cross the briny ocean,  
I will whistle and sing  
And since you’ve refused the offer, love,  
Some other girl shall wear the ring

I am frolicsome, and I am easy,  
Good-tempered and free  
And I don’t give a single pin, me boys,   
What the world thinks of me

# The Scotsman {#the-scotsman}

## *Mike Cross*

Well a Scotsman clad in kilt left a bar on evening fair  
And one could tell by how we walked that he drunk more than his share  
He fumbled round until he could no longer keep his feet  
**Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.**

**Ring ding diddle diddle i de o ring di diddly i o**  
**He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.**

About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by  
And one says to the other with a twinkle in her eye  
See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built  
**I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt.**

They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be  
Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see  
And there behold, for them to see, beneath his Scottish skirt  
**Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth.**

They marveled for a moment, then one said we must be gone  
Let's leave a present for our friend, before we move along  
As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon, tied into a bow  
**Around the bonnie star, the Scots kilt did lift and show.**

Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards a tree  
Behind a bush, he lift his kilt and gawks at what he sees  
And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes  
**“O lad I don't know where you’ve been but I see you won first prize.”**

The Scotsman he was numb with drink and his head was spinning round  
He couldn’t get that ribbon off, so homeward he was bound  
His wife she caught a flash of blue as he took off his clothes  
**And it piqued her curiosity as you might well suppose.**

Well then she asked that Scotsman where he’d been and what he’d done  
He said there was a contest at the pub and that he’d won  
She cried, “you did not show that thing in front of all those men?”  
**“I did not show it all my love, just enough that I would win.”**

Who owns that horse outside the door where my own horse should be?”   
***Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool, so you can not see***   
*Why that's the lovely dairy cow me mother gave to me*   
**Well, it's many a day I've travelled a hundred miles or more**

But a blanket with buttons on I’ve never seen before

But a tin whistle with tobacco in it, I’ve never seen before

I saw two boots beside the bed where my own boots should be   
Who owns those boots beside the bed where my own boots should be?”   
*They’re lovely Geranium pots me mother gave to me*   
But Geranium pots with laces on I’ve never seen before 

**Friday**  
I saw a head upon the bed where my own head should be   
Who owns that head upon the bed where my own head should be?”   
*That's a lovely baby boy me mother gave to me*   
But a baby boy with whiskers on I’ve never seen before   
   
**Saturday**  
I saw two mits upon the tits where my own mits should be   
Who owns those mits upon the tits where my old mits should be?”   
*That's the lovely lace brassiere that me mother gave to me*   
But a lace brassiere with fingernails on I’ve never seen before 

**Sunday**  
I saw a man inside the land where my own man should be  
Who owns that owns that man inside the land where my own man should be?”  
*That's the lovely shillelagh me mother gave to me*

# Shanghai Kelley 

## 

## *Gaelic Storm* 

   
Well on me own in San Francisco, in the year of 1849  
No money in me pockets, but there's mischief on me mind  
It was Jimmy Kelly’s birthday, a businessman of high renown  
He said he'd host a party, he invited half the town\!  
He said we'd all go drinkin’ on a paddle-steamer in the bay  
With barrels full of whiskey; sure we didn't have to pay  
But Kelly swiped the liquor, with a jigger full of maudlin  
A pint of chloral-hydrate and a shot of opium\!

**Beat-down\! Black-eyed\!**   
**Hobbled-up and hog-tied\!**  
**Shipped-out\! Shanghai’ed\!**   
**Ne'er a "fare thee well"\!**  
**Rope-burned\! Whip-cracked\!**   
**Burnt-back and hard-tack\!**  
**Davey Jones will steal your bones and send you down to Hell\! (x2)**

Well a lot of us, we hit the floor, ninety men or maybe more  
They rolled us up in blankets and they dragged us to the door  
They sold us to the Reefer just before she passed the Golden Gate  
Before we all got sober, we were married to our fate  
And miles away from all I knew, stranded with this rotten crew  
With naught but work for us to do until we reached Peru  
With blistered hands we'd haul the line, man the sails, swab the deck  
And dream of Shanghai Kelly with a rope around his neck\!

Now if you meet that Shanghai Kelly, you'd best take care around the booze  
A pint of piquet special, and you're surely bound to lose  
A year at sea and all I've got, when they dumped me on the docks  
A broken heart, a broken head, the scurvy and the pox (x2)

Shiver my timbers, shiver my soul   
**Yo ho heave ho**   
There are men whose hearts are as black as coal   
**Yo ho heave ho**   
   
And they sailed their ship cross the ocean blue   
A blood-thirsty captain and a cut-throat crew   
It’s as dark a tale as was ever told   
Of the lust for treasure and the love of gold   
   
Shiver my timbers, shiver my sides   
**Yo ho heave ho**   
There are hungers as strong as the wind and tides   
**Yo ho heave ho**   
   
And those buccaneers drowned their sins in rum

Every man aboard would have killed his mate   
For a bag of guineas or a piece of eight   
A piece of eight\! A piece of eight\! *five, six, seven, eight\![^29]*   
    
Shiver my timbers, shiver my bones

There’s no turning back from any course that’s laid

# Shoals Of Herring {#shoals-of-herring}

## *Ewan McColl*

With our nets and gear we’re faring  
On the wild and wasteful ocean  
It’s there on the deep that we harvest and reap our bread  
As we hunt the bonny shoals of herring

It was on a fair and a pleasant day  
Out of Yarmouth harbor I was faring  
As a cabin boy on a sailing lugger  
For to hunt the bonny shoals of herring

Now the work was hard and the hours were long  
And the treatment sure it took some bearing  
There was little kindness and the kicks were many  
As we hunted for the shoals of herring

Oh we left the home grounds in the month of June  
And for canny Shiels we soon were bearing  
With a hundred cran of the silver darlings  
That we’d taken from the shoals of herring

Oh we fished the Swarth and the Broken Bank  
I was a cook and I’d a quarter’s sharing  
And I used to sleep standing on me feet  
And I’d dream about the shoals of herring

Now you’re up on deck, you’re a fisherman  
You can swear and show a manly bearing  
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows  
While you’re following the shoals of herring

In the stormy seas and the living gales  
Just to earn the gear that I was wearing  
Sailed ten thousand miles, caught ten million fishes  
We was out there hunting shoals of herring

And it’s night and day we’re faring  
Come winter wave or winter gale  
Sweating or cold; growing up, growing old \[and dying\]  
As we hunt the bonnie shoals of herring

# The Sick Note {#the-sick-note}

## *From Humpy Gussy the Lumpy Hussy*

Dear Sir, I write this note to you to tell you of me plight  
And at the time of writing, I am not a pretty sight;  
Me body is all black and blue, me face a deathly gray  
And I write this note to say why Paddy's not at work today

While working on the fourteenth floor some bricks I had to clear;  
Now, to throw them down from such a height, it was not a good idea  
The foreman wasn't very pleased, he being an awkward sod  
He said I'd have to cart them down the ladders in me hod

Now, clearing all these bricks by hand it was so very slow  
So I hoisted up a barrel and secured the rope below  
But in me haste to do the job I was too blind to see  
That a barrelful of building bricks was heavier than me

So when I untied the rope the barrel fell like lead  
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead  
Well, I shot up like a rocket till to my dismay I found  
That halfway up I met the bloody barrel coming down

Well, the barrel broke me shoulder as to the ground it sped  
And when I reached the top I banged the pulley with me head  
Well, I clung on tight though numb with shock from this almighty blow  
And the barrel spilled out half the bricks fourteen floors below

Now, when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor  
I then outweighed the barrel and so started down once more;  
Still clinging tightly to the rope, I sped towards the ground  
And of course once more I met the fucking barrel coming down

Well, when I landed upon the bricks, I thought I'd passed the worst  
When the barrel hit the pulley-wheel and then the bottom burst  
Well, a shower of bricks rained down on me, I hadn't got a hope  
As I lay there losing consciousness, I let go the bloody rope

The barrel then being heavier, it started down once more  
And landed right across me as I lay upon the floor  
Well, it broke three ribs and my left arm and I can only say  
That I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today

# Sir Patrick Spens {#sir-patrick-spens}

## *From Corvis the Nightterror*

The king sits in Dumferling town  
Drinking the blood red wine  
"Where can I get a good Captain  
To sail this ship of mine?"  
Then up and spoke a sailor boy  
Sitting at the king's right knee  
"Sir Patrick Spens is the best Captain  
That ever sailed to sea"

The king he wrote a broad letter  
And he sealed it with his hand  
And sent it to Sir Patrick Spens  
Walking out on the strand  
To Norway, to Norway, to Norway  
To Norway or the foam  
With all my lords and finery  
To bring my new bride home

The first line that Sir Patrick read  
He gave a weary sigh  
The next line that Sir Patrick read  
A salt tear blinds his eye  
"Oh, who is it, oh, who is it  
Who told the king of me  
To set us out this time of year  
To sail across the sea?

But rest you well, my good men all  
Our ship must sail the morn  
With four and twenty noble lords  
Dressed up in silk so fine  
And four and twenty feather beds  
To lay their heads upon  
Away, away, we’ll all away  
To bring the king's bride home"

"I fear, I fear, My captain dear  
I fear we'll come to harm  
Last night I saw the new moon clear  
The old moon in her arm."  
"Oh be it fair, or be it foul  
Or be it deadly storm  
Oh, blow the wind where’er it will  
Our ship must sail the morn"

They hadn't sailed a day, a day  
A day but only one  
When loud and boisterous blew the wind  
And made the good ship moan  
They hadn't sailed a day, a day  
A day but only three  
When oh, the waves came o'er the side  
And rolled around their knees

They hadn't sailed a league, a league  
A league but only five  
When the anchor broke and the sails were torn  
And the ship began to rive  
They hadn't sailed a league, a league  
A league but only nine  
When oh, the waves came o'er the side  
Driving to their chins

"Who will climb the top mast high  
While I take helm in hand?  
Who will climb the top mast high  
To see if there be dry land?"  
"No shore, no shore, my Captain dear  
I haven't seen dry land  
But I have seen a lady fair  
With a comb and a glass in her hand"

"Come down, come down, you sailor boy  
I think you tarry long  
The salt sea’s in at my coat neck  
And out at my left arm  
Come down, come down, you sailor boy  
Tis here that we must die  
Our ship is torn at every side  
And now the sea comes in"

Loathe, loathe were those noble lords  
To wet their high-heeled shoes  
But long before the day was o’er  
Their hats, they swam above  
And many were the feathered beds  
That fluttered on the foam  
And many were those noble lords  
Who never did come home

It's fifty miles shore to shore  
And fifty fathoms deep  
And there lies good Sir Patrick Spens  
The lords all at his feet  
Long, long, may his lady look  
With a lantern in her hand  
Before she sees Sir Patrick Spens  
Come sailing home again

# South Australia {#south-australia}

   
In South Australia I was born   
**Heave away, haul away**   
South Australia, ’round Cape Horn   
**We’re bound for South Australia**   
   
**Haul away you rolling kings**   
**Heave away, haul away**   
**Haul away you’ll hear me say**   
**We’re bound for South Australia**   
   
If there’s just one thing that grieves my mind   
To leave Miss Nancy Blair’s behind   
   
Oh when we wallop ’round Cape Horn   
You’ll wish to God you’d never been born   
   
I wish I was in Australia’s strand   
A glass of whiskey in my hand   
   
South Australia’s my native land   
Full of flies and fleas and sand   
   
When I first shipped out to sea   
My girl said she’d be true to me   
   
South Australia’s got great waves   
Great white sharks and surfer babes   
   
Hamlet’s uncle’s got him down   
Married his mom and stole his crown

# Spanish Ladies {#spanish-ladies}

Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish Ladies,  
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain  
For we've received orders for to sail for old England  
But we hope in short time for to see you again

**We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors,**  
**We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas**  
**Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England**  
**From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues**

We hove our ship to with the wind from sou'west, boys  
We hove our ship to, deep soundings to take  
'Twas forty-five fathoms, with a white sandy bottom,  
So we squared our main yard and up channel did make

The first land we sighted was call-ed the Dodman,  
Next Rame Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland and Wight  
We sailed by Beachy, by Fairlight and Dover  
And then we bore up for the South Foreland light

Then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor,  
And all in the Downs that night for to lie  
Let go your shank painter, let go your cat stopper  
Haul up your clew garnets, let tacks and sheets fly\!

Now let ev'ry man drink off his full bumper,  
And let ev'ry man drink off his full glass  
We'll drink and be jolly and drown melancholy,  
And here's to the health of each true-hearted lass.

# Strike the Bell {#strike-the-bell}

## *From Willy-Nilly the Filibuster*

Up on the poop deck and walking about,  
There is the second mate so steady and so stout.  
What he is a-thinkin’ of he doesn’t want to tell,  
We wish that he would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.

**Strike the bell second mate, let us go below;**  
**Look ye well to windward you can see it’s going to blow.**  
**Look at the glass you can see that it has fell,**  
**We wish that you would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.**

Down on the main deck and workin’ at the pumps,  
There is the larboard watch just longing for their bunks;  
Look out to windward, you can see a great swell,  
We wish that he would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.

Forward on the forecastle head and keepin’ sharp lookout,  
There is Johnny standin’, a longin’ fer to shout,  
“Lights are burnin’ bright sir and everything is well.”  
He’s wishing that the second mate would, strike the bell.

Aft on the wheelhouse old Anderson stands,  
Graspin’ at the helm with his frostbitten hands,  
Lookin’ at the compass though the course is clear as hell;  
He’s wishin’ that the second mate would, strike the bell.

Aft on the quarter deck our gallant captain stands,  
Lookin’ out to windward with a spyglass in his hand.  
What he is a-thinkin’ of we know very well.  
He’s thinking more of shortenin’ sail than striking the bell.

# Sun Down Below {#sun-down-below}

## *Trad. West Indies, arr. Johnson Girls*

Six o'clock I hear 'em say  
**Sun down, sun down below**  
Time to quit and go away  
**Sun down, sun down below**

**A-a-a-a-aye**  
**Sun down, sun down below**  
**A-a-a-a-aye**  
**Sun down, sun down below**  
   
Sun is down in the hole below  
Time for us to roll and go  
   
Thought I heard my captain say  
Sun is down; go get your pay  
   
Pack your duds and dinner pail  
Come back sure before we sail  
   
Six o’clock; I heard them say  
Time for us to go away

# Sweet Mary Starbuck {#sweet-mary-starbuck}

## *From Meister Jaeger*

I married John Coffin just two years ago  
And he’s a fine man, as all Nantucket knows  
And he’s bound to make second mate, or so I hear  
If the Charles brings home enough oil next year  
At twenty a mother, at nineteen a bride  
With a child on my knee and another inside  
My heart it was broken, and swept out to sea  
Where my sweet Mary found it and brought it to me

**Sweet Mary Starbuck from Nantucket town**  
**If she were the sea I would willingly drown**  
**And her voice like a bell on a clear winter’s day**  
**Sets my heart a-ringing and winging away**

At meeting one morning she came to me there  
With the Nantucket wind in her flyaway hair  
Her hand, soft and certain, clasped mine in the lane  
And I felt my heart shiver when she spoke my name  
Her words came in whispers, in trembling lines  
Her cheeks red as roses, her eyes all a-shine  
Then she kissed me so gently, so soft and so sure  
The world spun round once, and at once I was hers

On Nantucket our men go to hunt for the whale  
And they live at the mercy of teeth, sea, and gale  
But in town life goes on, and it goes on apace  
With children, and letters, and Mary’s sweet face  
So when John comes I’ll give him a kiss and a smile  
And a good whaleman’s wife I will be for a while  
And in time I’ll stand watching his sail fade at sea  
Then go home where my true love lies waiting for me

# Take It From Day To Day {#take-it-from-day-to-day}

## *Stan Rogers*

Well it’s not the hours of watch on watch and it’s not the work that I mind so much  
Or the long cold miles from my lover’s touch, though for sure she’s far away  
No stranger I to the touch of steel, nor the honest fear any man can feel  
But I long for dust under my heels and a pocket full of pay  
So I’ll take it from day to day

The pack-ice ’round us cracks and groans, the old St. Roch, she creaks and moans  
The icy fog is in my bones and the ache won’t go away  
Outside I bet it’s warm and fair, I could have her fingers in my hair  
But it’s long cold miles to her out there, so I guess I’ll have to stay  
And just take it from day to day

We’re as far north now as I want to come, but Larson’s got us under his thumb  
And I signed up for the whole damn run, I can’t get off halfway  
But when I get back onto the shore I’m going south where it stays warm  
And there’ll be someone on my arm to help me spend my pay  
So I’ll take it from day to day  *(repeat final verse)*

# The Titanic {#the-titanic}

## *From Rabies the Regularly Bitten*

Oh, they built the great Titanic to sail the ocean blue,  
And they thought they had a ship that water’d never get through;  
But on its maiden trip, well, an iceberg struck the ship,  
**It was sad when the great ship went down** *\[blub blub blub\]*

**Oh it was sad\!** *\[so sad\]*  
**It was sad,** *\[too bad\]*  
**it was sad when the great ship went down,** *\[to the bottom of the…\]*  
**husbands and wives, little children lost their lives**  
**It was sad when the great ship went down** 

They were not far from the shore, maybe a thousand miles or more  
When the rich refused to associate with the poor,  
They sent them down below, where they were the first to go,

The ship was full of sin and the sides were ‘bout to burst,  
When the captain shouted, “Women and children first\!”  
The captain tried to wire, but the lines were all on fire,

They swung the lifeboats out o’er the dark and raging sea,  
As the band struck up *Nearer My God to Thee*,  
Little babies wept and cried, as the waves swept over side,

The captain stood on deck with a teardrop in his eye,  
As the last boat left he waved them all goodbye,  
But he knew he made a slip, so he went down with his ship,

The moral of the story, as you can plainly see  
Is to wear a life preserver, and never go out to sea  
‘Cause whether rich or poor, you’ll sink to the ocean floor\!

# Three Fishers {#three-fishers}

Three fishers went sailing out into the west,  
Out into the west as the sun went down,  
Each thought on the woman that loved him the best,  
And the children stood watching them out of the town.

**For men must work and women must weep,**  
**For there's little to earn and many to keep,**  
**And the harbor bar be moaning,**  
**The harbor bar be moaning.**

Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,  
They trimmed the lamps as the sun went down,  
And they looked at the squall and they looked at the shower,  
And the night-rack came rolling in, ragged and brown.

**For women must work and men must weep,**  
**Though storms be sudden and the waters be deep**  
**And the harbor bar be moaning,**  
**The harbor bar be moaning.**

Three corpses lay out on the shining sand,  
In the morning gleam as the tide went down,  
And the women were weeping and wringing their hands,  
For those who would never come back to the town.

**For we all must work and we all must weep,**  
**And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep**  
**And good-bye to the bar and its moaning,**  
**Good-bye to the bar and its moaning.**

# Tobacco Island [^32] {#tobacco-island}

**Off to hell we must sail for the shores of sweet Barbados**  
**Where the sugar cane grows taller than the God we once believed in**  
**Till the butcher and his crown raped the land we used to sleep in**  
**Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes that haunt Tobacco Island**

'Twas 1659 forgotten now for sure  
They dragged us from our homeland with the musket and their gun  
Cromwell and his roundheads battered all we know  
Shackled hopes of freedom  
We're now but stolen goods  
Dark is the horizon, blackened by the sun  
This rotten cage of Bridgetown is where I now belong

Red leg down a peg  
Blistered burns the soul  
The floggings they're a plenty, but reasons there are none  
Our backs belong to landlords where branded is their name  
Paid for with ten shillings  
Cheap labor never breaks  
The silver moon is shinin'  
Cools the copper blood  
Where the livin' meet the dead and together dance as one

Agony, will you cleanse this misery?  
For it's never again I'll breathe the air of home  
From this sandy edge the rolling sea breaks my revenge  
With each whisper a thousand waves I hear roar  
I'm coming home  
Dark is the horizon blackened by the sun  
This rotten cage of Bridgetown is where I now belong

# Wave Over Wave {#wave-over-wave}

Oh me name's Able Rodgers, a share man am I  
On a three masted schooner from Twillingate Isle  
I've been the world over north, south, east, and west  
But the middle of nowhere’s where I likes it best

**Where its wave over wave, sea over bow**  
**I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow**  
**There’s no other life for a sailor like me**  
**And to sail the salt sea boys, sail the sea**  
**There's no other life but to sail the salt sea**

Well I leave my wife lonely ten months of the year  
For she built me a home and raised my children there  
She never come out to bid farewell to me  
Or ken why a sailor must sail the salt sea

The work it is hard and the hours are long  
But my spirit is willing, my back it is strong  
And when the work’s over the whiskey will pour  
We'll dance with the girls upon some foreign shore

I've sailed the world over for decades or more  
And oft times I wonder what I do it for  
I don’t know the answer it’s pleasure and pain  
But with life to live over I'd do it again

# The Ways Of Man {#the-ways-of-man}

The ways of man are passing strange  
He buys his freedom and he counts his change  
Then he lets the wind his days arrange  
And he calls the tide his master

**Oh the days, oh the days**  
**Oh the fine long summer days**  
**The fish come rolling in the bays**  
**And he swore he'd never leave me**

But the days grow short and the year gets old  
And the fish won't stay where the water's cold  
And if they're going to fill the hold  
They've got to go offshore to find them

So they go outside on the raving deep  
And they pray the Lord their soul to keep  
But the waves will roll them all to sleep  
And the tide will be their keeper

**Oh the tide, oh the tide**  
**Oh you dark and you bitter tide**  
**If I can't have him by my side**  
**I guess I have to leave him**

I gave you one, I gave you two  
The best that rotten old boat could do  
You wouldn't be happy till I gave you three  
But I'll be damned if you'll get me

**Oh the tide, oh the tide,**  
**Oh you dark and you bitter tide**  
**If I can't have him by my side**  
**The water's welcome to him**

Oh Lord I know that the day will come  
When one less boat comes slogging home  
I don't mind knowing that he'll be the one  
But I can't spend my whole life praying

I gave you one, I gave you two  
The best that poor old boat could do  
You'd have it all before you're through  
Well I've got no more to give you

#  {#heading-1}

# Wellerman 

## *The Longest Johns*

**Soon may the Wellerman come**  
**To bring us sugar and tea and rum**  
**One day, when the tonguin' is done**  
**We'll take our leave and go**

There once was a ship that put to sea  
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea  
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down  
O blow, my bully boys, blow

She had not been two weeks from shore  
When down on her a right whale bore  
The captain called all hands and swore  
He'd take that whale in tow

Before the boat had hit the water  
The whale's tail came up and caught her  
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her  
When she dived down below

No line was cut, no whale was freed;  
The Captain's mind was not of greed  
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;  
She took the ship in tow

For forty days, or even more  
The line went slack, then tight once more  
All boats were lost (there were only four)  
But still that whale did go

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on;  
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone  
The Wellerman makes his regular call  
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all

# What Will We Do? {#what-will-we-do?}

## *From Long-Hard Susan*

What will we do if we have no money?  
Oh true lovers, what will we do then?  
I will hall through the town for a hungry crown  
And we'll yodel it over again

What will we do if we marry a tinker?  
Oh true lovers, what will we do then?  
I will sell a tin can and walk on with me man  
And we'll yodel it over again

What will we do if we marry a soldier?  
Oh true lovers, what will we do then ?  
All me handle is gone and I will fight for the fun  
And we'll yodel it over again

What will we do if we have a young daughter?  
Oh true lovers, what will we do then?  
I will take her in hand and we'll walk on with me man  
And we'll yodel it over again

What will we do if we have no money?  
Oh true lovers, what will we do then?

# Whiskey {#whiskey}

   
Whiskey is the life of man, I’ll drink whiskey when I can   
**Whiskey-o, Johnny-o**   
**Rise her up from down below**   
   
**Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey-o**   
**Up aloft this yard must go**   
**Rise her up from down below**   
   
I like whiskey hot and strong, I’ll drink whiskey all day long…   
   
I’ll drink it hot, I’ll drink it cold, I’ll drink it new, I’ll drink it old   
   
Whiskey made me sell my coat, whiskey’s what keeps me afloat   
   
If whiskey was a river and I was a duck, I'd dive to the bottom and never come up   
   
I wish I knew where whiskey grew, I'd eat the leaves and the branches too   
   
Some likes whiskey, some likes beer, I wish I had a barrel here   
   
Whiskey caused an awkward pause   
   
Whiskey made the bosun call “hang together, one and all”   
   
Whiskey stole my brains away, one more pull and we’ll belay   
   
*\[Only the captain or boatswain sings this line\!\]*  
A glass of grog for every man and a barrel full **for the shantyman**\!

# Whiskey In The Jar {#whiskey-in-the-jar}

As I was going over the far-famed Kerry Mountains  
I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was counting  
I first produced my pistol, and then produced my rapier  
Saying “stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver”

**Musha ring dum a do dum a da**  
**Whack fol the daddy-o, whack fol the daddy-o**  
**There’s whiskey in the jar**

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny  
I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny  
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me  
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber  
I dreamt of gold and jewels, and sure it was no wonder  
That Jenny took my changes and she filled them up with water  
And sent for Captain Farrell to make ready for the slaughter

T’was early in the morning, afore I rose to travel  
Up comes a band of footmen, and likewise Captain Farrell  
I first produced my pistol for she’d stolen away my rapier  
But I couldn’t shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken

Well they threw me in the jail, said the years I would be counting  
For robbing Captain Farrell in the far-famed Kerry Mountains  
But they didn’t take me fists so I knocked the jailer down  
And I bid a fond farewell to that jail in Liverpool town

If anyone can aid me it’s my brother in the army  
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney  
And if he’ll go with me we’ll go roving in Kilkenny  
I’m sure he’ll treat me better than my own disporting Jenny

There’s some take delight in the hurling and the bowling  
And some take delight in the carriages a-rolling  
But I take delight in the juice of the barley  
And courting pretty, fair maids in the morning bright and early

# Whiskey You’re The Devil {#whiskey-you’re-the-devil}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

Now brave boys we’re on for marching  
Off to Portugal or Spain  
The drums are beating, banners flying  
The devil at home will come tonight  
Love, fair thee well

**With me tiddlee aye dul do dul dum a dah**  
**Me tiddlee aye dul do dul dum a dah**  
**Me rightful toora laddie**  
**Oh, there’s whiskey in the jar**

**Oh, whiskey, you’re the devil, you’re leading me astray**  
**Over hills and mountains, and to a merry quay**  
**You’re sweet, you’re strong, you’re decent**  
**Oh, you’re spunkier than tay**  
**Oh, whiskey, you’re me darling drunk or sober**

Said the mother, “do not wrong me,  
Don’t take me daughter from me  
For if you do I will torment you  
And after that me ghost will haunt you”  
Love, fair thee well

Oh, the French are fighting boldly  
Men are dying hot and cowardly  
Give every man his flash and powder  
His firelock on his shoulder  
Love, fare thee well

**Ranzo, Ranzo, way-hey\!**  
They’re just like them pretty girls when they gets the notion.  
**Ranzo, Ranzo, way-hey\!**

The other morning I was walking by the river  
When I saw a young girl walking with her topsails all a-quiver.

I said, “Pretty fair maid, and how are you this morning?”  
She said, “None the better for the seeing of you.”

Did you ever see a wild goose sailing o’er the ocean?

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

Oh, the summertime is coming  
And the trees, they are a-blooming  
And the wild mountain thyme   
Grows among the blooming heather

**Will ye go, lassie, go**  
**And we’ll all go together**  
**To pick wild mountain thyme**  
**All around the blooming heather**  
**Will ye go, lassie, go**

I will build my love a bower  
By yon pure and crystal fountain  
And around it I will pile  
All the flowers of the mountain

If me love should ever leave me  
I will surely find another  
Where the wild mountain thyme  
Grows around the blooming heather

# Wild Rover {#wild-rover}

## *Formerly in the Irish Packet*

I've played the Wild Rover for many a year  
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer  
But now I'm returning with gold in great store  
And I never will play the Wild Rover no more.

**And it's no, nay, never** *\[hike up your kilt\]*  
**No nay never no more**  
**Will I play the Wild Rover**  
**No never, no more.**

I went to an alehouse I used to frequent  
And I told the landlady me money was spent  
I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay,"  
“Such custom as yours I could have any day\!"

I took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright  
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight  
She said, "I have whiskeys, and wines of the best,  
And the words that I told you was only in jest\!"

I’ll return to my parents, confess what I’ve done  
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son  
And when they forgive me, as oft' times before  
Then I never will play the Wild Rover no more.

# Working on the Railway {#working-on-the-railway}

## *From Meister Jaeger*

In 1841 I put me corduroy britches on  
I put me corduroy britches on  
To work upon the railway 

**Tira me ori ori ay, tira me ori ori ay**  
**Tira me ori ori ay, to work upon the railway** 

In 1842 I left the old land for the new  
Bad cess to the luck that brought me through  
To work upon the railway 

In 1843 we hit Chicago on a spree  
The devil got a hold of me  
While working on the railway 

In 1844 while standing on the great lake shore  
We laid the track then saw no more  
While working on the railway 

In 1845 when Daniel O'Connell was alive  
In Kansas City we did arrive  
To work upon the railway 

In 1846 had a pain in me ass from carrying bricks  
With hammers and nails and shovels and picks  
A working upon the railway 

In 1848 me hands did blister and me belly did ache  
We heard of gold and made a stake  
While working on the railway 

In 1849 the California hills looked fine  
We found some gold and left behind  
The workings of the railway
