<h1>General Taylor</h1>
<p>General Taylor gained the day<br />
<strong>Walk him along, John carry him along</strong>* *<br />
General Taylor gained the day<br />
<strong>Carry him to his burying ground</strong>* *<br />
* *<br />
<strong>To me way, hey, you stormy </strong><br />
<strong>Walk him along, John carry him along </strong><br />
<strong>To me way, hey, you stormy </strong><br />
<strong>Carry him to his burying ground </strong></p>
<p>We’ll dig his grave with a silver spade…<br />
His shroud of the finest silk will be made…</p>
<p>We’ll lower him down on a golden chain<br />
On every inch we’ll carve his name</p>
<p>General Taylor he’s all the go<br />
He's gone where the stormy winds won’t blow</p>
<p>General Taylor he’s dead and he's gone<br />
General Taylor he’s long dead and gone</p>
