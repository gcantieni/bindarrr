<h1>Santiano</h1>
<p>Oh, Santiano gained the day<br />
<strong>Away Santiano</strong> <br />
Oh, Santiano gained the day<br />
<strong>All on the plains of Mexico</strong></p>
<p>To Mexico, oh Mexico <br />
To Mexico, where I must go</p>
<p>O! Santiano had a wooden leg<br />
He used it for a cribbage peg</p>
<p>O! Santiano fought for his gold<br />
The deeds he did have oft been told</p>
<p>He won the day at Molly-Del-Rey,<br />
And General Taylor he ran away.</p>
<p>O! Santiano fought for his life,<br />
He gained his way in the terrible strife.</p>
<p>O! Santiano's men were brave,<br />
Many found a hero's grave.</p>
<p>O! Santiano's day is o'er,<br />
Santiano will fight no more.</p>
<p>O! Santiano's day is gorn,<br />
We left him buried off Cape Horn.</p>
<p>We dug his grave with a golden spade,<br />
And marked the spot where he was laid.</p>
