<h1>Old Turf Fire</h1>
<p><strong>Oh the old turf fire</strong><br />
<strong>And the hearth swept clean</strong><br />
<strong>Sure there's no one half so happy</strong><br />
<strong>As meself and Paddy Keane</strong><br />
<strong>With the baby in the cradle</strong><br />
<strong>You can hear her mammy say</strong><br />
<strong>Ah wouldn't you go to sleep Alanna</strong><br />
**‘Til I wet your Daddy's tea*.**</p>
<p>Oh I've got a little house<br />
And a tidy bit of land<br />
Sure you'd never see the better<br />
On this side of Cnoc na gCrann**<br />
I've no piano in the corner<br />
And no pictures on the wall<br />
Ah but sure I'm quite contented<br />
In me little marble hall.</p>
<p>Oh the man that I work for<br />
Is a richer man than me<br />
But somehow I'll be telling you<br />
We never can agree.<br />
He has big towering mansions<br />
And he's castles over all<br />
But sure I'd never exchange with him<br />
Me little marble hall</p>
<p>Oh the old turf fire<br />
What a welcome now it brings<br />
As the cricket chirrups gaily<br />
And the kettle also sings<br />
We all join in the chorus<br />
Of a merry lilting song<br />
With the friendly neighbours dropping in<br />
To join in the happy throng.</p>
<p>Round the old turf fire<br />
Sit the old folk bent with years<br />
As they watch us tripping lightly<br />
And they're smilin' through their tears<br />
For so sadly they are dreaming<br />
Of their youthful hearts desire<br />
And those dear old days so long ago<br />
Round the old turf fire.</p>
