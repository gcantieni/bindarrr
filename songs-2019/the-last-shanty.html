<h1>The Last Shanty</h1>
<p>Tom Lewis (additional verse by ARRR!!!)</p>
<p>My father often told me when I was just a lad<br />
A sailor’s life is very hard, the food is always bad<br />
But now I’ve joined the Navy, I’m on board a man-o’-war<br />
And now I find a sailor ain’t a sailor anymore</p>
<p><strong>Don’t haul on the rope, don’t climb up the mast </strong><br />
<strong>If you see a sailing ship it might be your last </strong><br />
<strong>Just get your civvies ready for another run ashore </strong><br />
<strong>A sailor ain’t a sailor ain’t a sailor anymore </strong></p>
<p>The killick of our mess he says we’ve had it soft<br />
It wasn’t like this in his day when he was up aloft<br />
We like our bunks and sleeping bags, but what’s a hammock for?<br />
Swinging from the deckhead or lying on the floor?</p>
<p>They gave us an engine that first went up and down<br />
Then with more technology the engine went around<br />
We’re good with steam and diesel, but what’s a mainyard for?<br />
A stoker ain’t a stoker with a shovel anymore</p>
<p>They gave us an Aldis Lamp so we can do it right<br />
They gave us a radio, we signal day and night<br />
We know our codes and ciphers, but what’s a "sema" for?<br />
A bunting-tosser doesn’t toss the bunting anymore</p>
<p>They gave us a radar set to pierce the fog and gloom<br />
Now the lookout’s sitting in a tiny darkened room<br />
Loran does navigation, the sonar says how deep<br />
The Jimmy’s three sheets to the wind, the skipper’s fast asleep</p>
<p>They gave us a songbook so we’d know what to do<br />
They gave us some MP3s, we listened to ’em to<br />
We know our scales and harmonies, but what’s a cutlass for?<br />
A pirate ain’t a pirate ain’t a pirate anymore</p>
<p>Two cans of beer a day, that’s your bleeding lot<br />
But now we gets an extra one because they stopped the Tot<br />
So, we’ll put on our civvy-clothes and find a pub ashore<br />
A sailor’s still a sailor, just like he was before</p>
