<h1>The Night That Paddy Murphy Died</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>Oh, the night that Paddy Murphy died is a night I’ll never forget<br />
Some of the boys got loaded drunk, and they ain’t been sober yet<br />
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feeling gay<br />
O’Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play</p>
<p><strong>That’s how they showed their respect for Paddy Murphy</strong><br />
<strong>That’s how they showed their honor and their pride</strong><br />
<strong>They said it was a sin and shame and they winked at one another</strong><br />
<strong>And every drink in the place was full the night Pat Murphy died</strong></p>
<p>As Mrs. Murphy sat in the corner pouring out her grief<br />
Kelly and his gang came tearing down the street<br />
They went into an empty room and a bottle of whiskey stole<br />
They put the bottle with the corpse to keep that whiskey cold</p>
<p>About two o’clock in the morning after emptying the jug<br />
Doyle rolls up the icebox lid to see poor Paddy’s mug<br />
We stopped the clock so Mrs. Murphy couldn’t tell the time<br />
And at a quarter after two we argued it was nine</p>
<p>They stopped the hearse on George Street outside some damn saloon<br />
They all went in at half past eight and staggered out at noon<br />
They went up to the graveyard, so holy and sublime<br />
Found out when they got there, they’d left the corpse behind</p>
<p>Oh, `rphy died is a night I’ll never forget<br />
Some of the boys got loaded drunk and they ain’t been sober yet<br />
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feeling gay<br />
O’Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play</p>
