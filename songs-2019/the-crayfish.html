<h1>The Crayfish</h1>
<p>"Fisherman, fisherman, standing by the sea,<br />
Have you a crayfish that you can sell to me?"<br />
<strong>By the wayside i-diddle-i-doh.</strong></p>
<p>"Yes sir, yes sir, that indeed I do.<br />
I've got a crayfish that I can sell to you."</p>
<p>Well, I took him on home and I thought he'd like a swim,<br />
So I filled up the thunderjug and I threw the bugger in.</p>
<p>Late that night I thought I'd have a fit<br />
When my old lady got up to <em>wash her face</em>.</p>
<p>"Husband, husband," she cried out to me,<br />
"The devil's in the thunderjug and he's got hold of me!"</p>
<p>"Children, children, bring the looking glass.<br />
Come and see the crayfish that bit your mother's <em>a-face</em>"</p>
<p>"Children, children, did you hear the grunt?<br />
Come and see the crayfish that bit your mother's <em>nose</em>”</p>
<p>That's the end of my song and there isn’t anymore.<br />
I’ve an apple in me pocket and you can have the core.</p>
<p>( <em>alternate: )</em><br />
That's the end of my song and I don't give a fuck.<br />
There's a lemon up my asshole and you can have a suck.</p>
