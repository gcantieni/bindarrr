<h1>Foggy Dew</h1>
<p>From Tripple Nipple Jones</p>
<p>As down the glen one Easter morn, to a city fair rode I<br />
There arm-ed lines of marching men, in squadrons passed me by<br />
No fife did hum, nor battle drum, did sound its dread tattoo,<br />
But the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out through the foggy dew</p>
<p>Right proudly high over Dublin Town, they hung out the flag of war<br />
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky, than at Sulva (NOTE: Pronounced "Sool-vuh.") or Sud El Bar (NOTE: “Sood-El-Bar”)<br />
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through<br />
While Britannia's Huns, with their long range guns, sailed in through the foggy dew</p>
<p>Oh the night fell black, and the rifles' crack made perfidious Albion reel<br />
In the leaden rain, seven tongues of flame did shine o'er the lines of steel<br />
By each shining blade a prayer was said, that to Ireland her sons be true<br />
But when morning broke, still the war flag shook out its folds in the foggy dew</p>
<p>'Twas Britannia bade our Wild Geese go, that small nations might be free<br />
But their lonely graves are by Sulva's waves, or the shore of the Great North Sea<br />
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Cathal Brugha (NOTE: "Ca-ull Brew")<br />
Their names we will keep, where the fenians sleep, 'neath the shroud of the foggy dew</p>
<p>But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell, rang mournfully and clear<br />
For those who died, that Eastertide, in the springing of the year<br />
And the world did gaze, in deep amaze, at those fearless men but few<br />
Who bore the fight, that freedom's light, might shine through the foggy dew</p>
