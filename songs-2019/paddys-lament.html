<h1>Paddy’s Lament</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>Well it's by the hush, me boys, and that’s to mind your noise<br />
And listen to poor Paddy's sad narration<br />
For I was by hunger pressed, and in poverty distressed<br />
So I took a thought to leave the Irish nation</p>
<p><strong>Hear me, boys, now take my advice</strong><br />
<strong>To America I'll have ye not be going</strong><br />
<strong>There is nothing here but war, where the murderin' cannons roar</strong><br />
<strong>And I wish I was at home in dear old Dublin</strong></p>
<p>Well I sold me horse and cow, my little pigs and sow<br />
My father’s plot of land I soon departed<br />
And me sweetheart Bidd McGee, I'm afraid I'll never see<br />
For I left her there that morning broken-hearted</p>
<p>Well meself and a hundred more, to America sailed o'er<br />
Our fortunes to be makin’ we were thinkin'<br />
But when we got to Yankee land, they shoved a gun into our hands<br />
Saying, "Paddy, you must go and fight for Lincoln"</p>
<p>General Meagher to us he said, if you get shot or lose your head<br />
Every mother’s son of you will get a pension<br />
Well in the war I lost me leg; all I have’s this wooden peg,<br />
And by God this is the truth to you I mention</p>
<p>Well I think meself in luck, if I get fed on Indian buck<br />
And old Ireland is the country I delight in<br />
With the devil, I do say, it's curse Americay<br />
For I think I've had enough of your hard fightin’</p>
