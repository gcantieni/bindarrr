<h1>Courting In The Kitchen</h1>
<p>Formerly in the Irish Packet</p>
<p>Come single belle and beau, to me now pay attention<br />
And love, I’ll plainly show, is the devil’s own invention<br />
For once I fell in love with a damsel so bewitchin’<br />
Miss Henrietta Bell, down in Captain Kelly’s kitchen</p>
<p><strong>To me toora loora la, to me toora loora laddy</strong><br />
<strong>To me toora loora la, and me toora loora laddy</strong></p>
<p>At the age of seventeen I was ’prenticed to a grocer<br />
Not far from Stephen’s Green where Miss Bell she used to go, sir<br />
Her manners were so free, she set my heart a-twitchin’<br />
And she invited me to a hooley in the kitchen</p>
<p>Next Sunday being the day we were to have the flare-up<br />
I dressed myself quite gay and I frizzed and oiled my hair up<br />
The Captain had no wife, and he had gone a-fishin’<br />
So we kicked up high life down belowstairs in the kitchen</p>
<p>Just as the clock struck six we sat down to the table<br />
She handed tea and cakes and I ate while I was able<br />
I drank hot punch and tea ’til my side had got a stitch in<br />
And the hours passed quick ‘way when you’re courting in the kitchen</p>
<p>With my arms around her waist, she slyly hinted marriage<br />
When to the door in haste came Captain Kelly’s carriage<br />
Her eyes were full of hate and poison she was spittin’<br />
The captain kicked the door in and he stormed into the kitchen</p>
<p>She flew up off my knees, full five feet up or higher<br />
And over heads and heels threw me slap in to the fire<br />
My new Repealers coat that I’d bought from Mr. Mitchum<br />
With a twenty-shilling note went to blazes in the kitchen</p>
<p>I grieved to see my duds all smeared with soot and ashes<br />
When a tub of dirty suds right in my face she dashes<br />
As I lay on the floor and the water she kept pitchin’<br />
The footman broke the door and walked right in to the kitchen</p>
<p>I said she did invite me, but she gave flat denial<br />
For assault she did indict me, and I was sent for trial<br />
She swore I robbed the house, in spite of all her screechin’<br />
And I got six months hard for my courting in the kitchen</p>
