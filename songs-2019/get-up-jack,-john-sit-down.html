<h1>Get Up Jack, John Sit Down</h1>
<p>Well ships may come and ships may go, as long as the seas do roll<br />
And a sailor lad, just like his dad, he loves his rum and bowl<br />
Now a lass ashore he do adore, a woman who’s plump and round<br />
But when your money’s all gone it’s the same old song:</p>
<p><strong>Get up Jack, John sit down! </strong><br />
<strong>Come along, come along me jolly brave boys </strong><br />
<strong>There’s plenty more grog in the jar </strong><br />
<strong>We’ll plow the briny ocean with a jolly roving tar </strong></p>
<p>When Jack’s ashore he’ll make his way to some old boarding house<br />
He’s welcomed in with rum and gin, likewise with fork and scouse<br />
And he’ll spend and he’ll spend and never offend, ’til he lies drunk on the ground…</p>
<p>When Jack is old and weather-beat, too old to sail about<br />
They’ll let him stop at some grog shop ’til eight bells calls him out<br />
Then he’ll raise his glass high, and loudly he’ll cry "Thank God I’m homeward bound…"</p>
