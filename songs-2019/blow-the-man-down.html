<h1>Blow The Man Down</h1>
<p>As I was a-walkin’ down Paradise Street<br />
<em>(To me!)</em> <strong>Way, hey, blow the man down</strong><br />
A pretty young damsel I chanced for to meet<br />
<strong>Give me some time to blow the man down</strong></p>
<p>She was round in the corner and bluff in the bow…<br />
So I took in all sail and cried "Way enough now"…</p>
<p>I threw out my hawser and took her in tow<br />
And yardarm to yardarm away did we go</p>
<p>She said to me "Sir, will you stand for the treat?"<br />
"Delighted," says I, “for a charmer so sweet”</p>
<p>It was up in her quarters she piped me aboard<br />
And there on her bed I cut loose with my sword</p>
<p>But just as my cutter was forging ahead<br />
She shouted "My husband!" and jumped out of bed</p>
<p>He was seven feet tall, had a chest like a horse<br />
And right for my jawbone he plotted his course</p>
<p>He loosened my rigging, he kicked me in stays<br />
I flew down the stairs like a ship on the way</p>
<p>I chanced on a packet that happened on by<br />
And when I awoke I was bound for Shanghai</p>
<p>So I’ll give you fair warning before we belay<br />
Don’t ever take heed of what pretty girls say</p>
