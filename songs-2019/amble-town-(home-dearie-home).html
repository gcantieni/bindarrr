<h1>Amble Town (Home Dearie Home)</h1>
<p>Recorded by Ed Trickett</p>
<p>O Amble is a fine town with ships about the bay<br />
It's fain and very fain to be there myself today<br />
I'm wishing in my heart I was far away from here<br />
Sitting in my parlor and talking with my dear</p>
<p><strong>And it's home, dearie, home, it's home I want to be</strong><br />
<strong>My topsails are hoisted and I am out to sea</strong><br />
<strong>The oak and the ash and the bonnie birchen tree</strong><br />
<strong>Are all a-growing green in the North country</strong><br />
<strong>And it's home, dearie, home</strong></p>
<p>A letter came today, but somehow I cannot speak<br />
And the proud and happy tears are a-rolling down my cheeks<br />
There's someone here, she says, you've been waiting for to see<br />
With your merry hazel eyes, looking up from off my knee</p>
<p>But the letter never said if we have a boy or girl<br />
Got me so confused that my heart is all a whirl<br />
So I'm going back to port, where I'll quickly turn around<br />
And take the fastest ship, which to Ambletown is bound</p>
<p>Well, if it be a girl, she shall wear a golden ring<br />
If it be a boy, he shall live to serve the King<br />
With his buckles and his boot and his little jacket blue<br />
He'll walk the quarterdeck, like his daddy used to do</p>
