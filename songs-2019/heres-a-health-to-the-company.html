<h1>Here’s A Health to the Company</h1>
<p>Transcribed by Humpy Gussy from the Chieftains</p>
<p>Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme<br />
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine<br />
Come lift up your voices all grief to refrain<br />
For we may or might never all meet here again</p>
<p><strong>So here’s a health to the company and one to my lass</strong><br />
<strong>Let’s drink and be merry all out of one glass</strong><br />
<strong>Let’s drink and be merry, all grief to refrain</strong><br />
<strong>For we may or might never all meet here again</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a health to the wee lass that I love so well<br />
For style and for beauty there’s none can excel<br />
There’s a smile on her countenance as she sits on my knee<br />
There is no man in this wide world as happy as me</p>
<p>Our ship lies at anchor, she is ready to dock<br />
I wish her safe landing without any shock<br />
And if ever I should meet you by land or by sea<br />
I will always remember your kindness to me</p>
